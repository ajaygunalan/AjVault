##### Questions
- Are benign tumor and dysplasia same? If not, what's the difference?
	- benign tumors are stressed cells whose effect are irreversible
	- dysplasia are stressed cells but the effect are reversible.

	- ![[Medical/Attachments/Dyslpasia-Cancer-Pathway-Malignant-Metastasis.png]]
	- ![[Medical/Attachments/Difference-betwen-benign-and-malignant.png]]
- What is the difference between malignant tumor and benign tumor?
	- Malignant cells have the ability to invade tissue and metastasize** (spread to other sites) while benign tumors do not. However, malignant cancers don’t always invade and metastasize. [src](http://www.stomponstep1.com/dysplasia-difference-between-benign-and-malignant/)
- What is the difference between carcinoma and melanoma ? (Both are in skin right?)
	- Nope, they are not. Skin is made up of epithelial tissue and other types of tissue.
- lymph [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCPyWFK0IKs)
	- Heart pumps 20 liters per day. But, gets back only 17 liters per day.
	- The remaining 3 liters per day are pumped back to heart by lumph system
	- They also help in immunity.
- mucous membrane or mucosa [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane) ^60e38a
	- It is version of skin for inner muscles. 
	- Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid. 
	- Its function is to stop: pathogens, dirt and dehydration.

#### Throat
- Trachea vs esophagus ^8acae9
	-  wind pipe (trachea) and food pipe (esophagus)
- Vocal fold

##### Larynx

^9186fd

- [Nice endoscopic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6K35fvBjn4&t=230s)
- Larynx ([[Medical/Voice Disorders#^d70ee6|voice box]]) ^b23707
	- Etymology
		- Larynx -> the upper windpipe
	- Functions
		- open
			- breathing
		- partially open
			- phonation
		- closed
			- protects respiratory system
	- The thing that saves you when you eat everyday.
		- Epiglottis: A cap that a covers the larynx when we swallow. [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrZ3LZqrV7w)  ^1f75a6
		- Top of the airway is glottis.

##### Pharynx ^003543
- Etymology
	- pharynx -> throat
- Functions
	- It moves food from the mouth to the esophagus. It also moves air from the nasal and oral "Human mouth" cavities to the larynx. It is also used in human speech; pharyngeal consonants are articulated here.



#### Anatomical Terms
#####  Superior and Inferior
######  refers to a higher (superior) or lower (inferior) anatomical position in the vertical axis.
######  example
-  The nose is superior to the mouth.
-  The lungs are superior to the liver.
-  The appendix is (usually) inferior to the transverse colon.  
#####  Medial and Lateral
######  Medial -> midline of the body. lateral -> away from the midline of the body.
######  example
-  The eye is lateral to the nose.
-  The nose is medial to the ears.
-  The brachial artery lies medial to the biceps tendon.    
#####  Anterior and Posterior
######	Anterior -> front; posterior -> back ^e5f408
######	example
-	The heart is posterior to the sternum because it lies behind it. 
-	Equally, the sternum is anterior to the heart because it lies in front of it.
-	The triceps are posterior to biceps. 
#####  Proximal and Distal
######  used in structures that are considered to have a beginning and an end (such as the upper limb, lower limb and blood vessels).
######  proximal-> closer to its origin; distal -> away.
###### example
-  The wrist joint is distal to the elbow joint.
-  The knee joint is proximal to the ankle joint.


### The regulatory journey for MedTech startups: Some tips and tricks

[link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/regulatory-journey-medtech-startups-some-tips-tricks-rai-dastidar/)

To conclude, we would like to highlight a few critical things that you must take care of in your regulatory journey:

-   Starting early: Sooner the better.
-   Know the regulations: Get experts on board and follow their advice.
-   Implement the ISO 13485 processes.
-   Do a thorough risk assessment.
-   Hardware testing is important and time consuming. Start early and iterate to quickly identify the shortcomings well before the final compliance tests are done.
-   Clinical and usability validation are absolutely critical. Plan this well.







	



	
#### Dumpster
Barrett's esophagus

It is a condition in which there is an abnormal change in the [[Medical/Medical Terms#^60e38a|mucosal]] cells  lining the lower portion of the [[Medical/Medical Terms#^8acae9|esophagus]], from normal stratified squamous epithelium to simple columnar epithelium ([[Medical/Medical Terms#^9b2131|epithelial]]) with interspersed [[Medical/Medical Terms#^ac42d7|goblet cells]] that are normally present only in the small intestine and large intestine. This change is considered to be a premalignant condition because it is associated with a high incidence of further transition to esophageal adenocarcinoma, an often-deadly cancer.


It is diagnosed by endoscopy: 
	- observing the characteristic appearance of this condition by direct inspection of the lower esophagus.
	- followed by microscopic examination of tissue from the affected area obtained from biopsy.
