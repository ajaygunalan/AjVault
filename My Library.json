  {"id":"Abouzeid2014Femtosecondlaser","abstract":"Introduced in 2008, the femtosecond laser is a promising new technological advance which plays an ever increasing role in cataract surgery where it automates the three main surgical steps: corneal incision, capsulotomy and lens fragmentation. The proven advantages over manual surgery are: a better quality of incision with reduced induced astigmatism; increased reliability and reproducibility of the capsulotomy with increased stability of the implanted lens; a reduction in the use of ultrasound. Regarding refractive results or safety, however, no prospective randomized study to date has shown signiﬁcant superiority compared with standard manual technique. The signiﬁcant extra cost generated by this laser, undertaken by the patient, is a limiting factor for both its use and study. This review outlines the potential beneﬁts of femtosecondlaser-assisted cataract surgery due to the automation of key steps and the safety of this new technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Abouzeid","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Ferrini","given":"Walter"}],"citation-key":"Abouzeid2014Femtosecondlaser","container-title":"Acta Ophthalmologica","container-title-short":"Acta Ophthalmol","DOI":"10.1111/aos.12416","ISSN":"1755375X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11]]},"language":"en","page":"597-603","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Femtosecond-laser assisted cataract surgery: a review","title-short":"Femtosecond-laser assisted cataract surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/aos.12416","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"Acemoglu2017Magnetic","abstract":"Scanning lasers increase the quality of the laser microsurgery enabling fast tissue ablation with less thermal damage. However, the possibility to perform scanning laser microsurgery in confined workspaces is restricted by the large size of currently available actuators, which are typically located outside the patient and require direct line-of-sight to the microsurgical area. Here, a magnetic scanner tool is designed to allow endoscopic scanning laser microsurgery. The tool consists of two miniature electromagnetic coil pairs and permanent magnets attached to a flexible optical fiber. The actuation mechanism is based on the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the permanent magnets. Controlled and high-speed laser scanning is achieved by bending of the optical fiber with magnetic torque. Results demonstrate the achievement of a 3×3 mm2 scanning range within the laser spot is controlled with 35μm precision. The system is also capable of automatically executing high-speed laser scanning operations over customized trajectories with a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) in the order of 75μm. Furthermore, it can be teleoperated in real-time using any appropriate user interface device. This new technology enables laser scanning in narrow and difficult to reach workspaces, promising to bring the benefits of scanning laser microsurgery to laparoscopic or even flexible endoscopic procedures. In addition, the same technology can be potentially used for optical fiber based imaging, enabling for example the creation of new family of scanning endoscopic OCT or hyperspectral probes.","author":[{"family":"Acemoglu","given":"Alperen"},{"family":"Mattos","given":"Leonardo S."}],"citation-key":"Acemoglu2017Magnetic","container-title":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989485","event-title":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"page":"4215-4220","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Magnetic laser scanner for endoscopic microsurgery","type":"paper-conference"},

Most PACT systems employ a large footprint, bulky, and high-cost lasers. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) based B-mode photoacoustic imaging systems have emerged as a low cost and compact alternative, offering a unique opportunity to expedite the widespread adoption of photoacoustic imaging in clinical and resource-poor settings. The high pulse repetition rate of LEDs facilitates signal-to-noise ratio improvements through averaging in spite of lower pulse energy. Here, we present the development of first low-cost LED-based PACT system that uses multiple LED arrays and a linear ultrasound transducer to generate three-dimensional structural, functional and molecular images of the object. Similar to OPO based lasers, our LED-PACT system allows for the multi-wavelength photoacoustic imaging vital for mapping functional and molecular information. Our experiments demonstrate that this study will enable clinical and pre-clinical applications such as imaging human arthritis and whole body mouse imaging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Agrawal","given":"Sumit"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xinyi"},{"family":"Albahrani","given":"Hussain"},{"family":"Fadden","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Dangi","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Mithun Kuniyil Ajith"},{"family":"Kothapalli","given":"Sri-Rajasekhar"}],"citation-key":"Agrawal2020Lowcost","container-title":"Photons Plus Ultrasound: Imaging and Sensing 2020","DOI":"10.1117/12.2546993","event-title":"Photons Plus Ultrasound: Imaging and Sensing 2020","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,17]]},"page":"326-333","publisher":"SPIE","source":"www.spiedigitallibrary.org","title":"Low-cost photoacoustic computed tomography system using light-emitting-diodes","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11240/1124058/Low-cost-photoacoustic-computed-tomography-system-using-light-emitting-diodes/10.1117/12.2546993.full","volume":"11240"},

  {"id":"Almasi2020Registration","abstract":"Accurate and automatic registration of multimodal retinal images such as ﬂuorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables utilization of supplementary information. FA is a gold standard imaging modality that depicts neurovascular structure of retina and is used for diagnosing neurovascular-related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). Unlike FA, OCT is non-invasive retinal imaging modality that provides cross-sectional data of retina. Due to diﬀerences in contrast, resolution and brightness of multimodal retinal images, the images resulted from vessel extraction of image pairs are not exactly the same. Also, prevalent feature detection, extraction and matching schemes do not result in perfect matches. In addition, the relationships between retinal image pairs are usually modeled by aﬃne transformation, which cannot generate accurate alignments due to the non-planar retina surface. In this paper, a precise registration scheme is proposed to align FA and OCT images via scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) photographs as intermediate images. For this purpose, ﬁrst a retinal vessel segmentation is applied to extract main blood vessels from the FA and SLO images. Next, a novel global registration is proposed based on the Gaussian model for curved surface of retina. For doing so, ﬁrst a global rigid transformation is applied to FA vessel-map image using a new feature-based method to align it with SLO vessel-map photograph, in a way that outlier matched features resulted from not-perfect vessel segmentation are completely eliminated. After that, the transformed image is globally registered again considering Gaussian model for curved surface of retina to improve the precision of the previous step. Eventually a local non-rigid transformation is exploited to register two images perfectly. The experimental results indicate the presented scheme is more precise compared to other registration methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Almasi","given":"Ramin"},{"family":"Vafaei","given":"Abbas"},{"family":"Ghasemi","given":"Zeinab"},{"family":"Ommani","given":"Mohammad Reza"},{"family":"Dehghani","given":"Ali Reza"},{"family":"Rabbani","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"Almasi2020Registration","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

To address these limitations, the use of a ﬂexible, coherent ﬁbre bundle to interrogate the FP sensor has been investigated. A laboratory set-up comprising an x-y scanner, a commercially available, 1.35 mm diameter, 18,000 core ﬂexible ﬁbre bundle with a custom-designed telecentric optical relay at its distal end was used. Measurements of the optical and acoustic performance of the FP sensor were made and compared to that obtained using a conventional free-space FP based scanner. Spatial variations in acoustic sensitivity were greater and the SNR lower with the ﬁbre bundle implementation but high quality photoacoustic images could still be obtained. 3D images of phantoms and ex vivo tissues with a spatial resolution and ﬁdelity consistent with a free-space scanner were acquired. By demonstrating the feasibility of interrogating the FP sensor with a ﬂexible ﬁbre bundle, this study advances the realization of compact hand-held clinical scanners and ﬂexible endoscopic devices based on the FP sensing concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ansari","given":"Rehman"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Edward Z."},{"family":"Desjardins","given":"Adrien E."},{"family":"David","given":"Anna L."},{"family":"Beard","given":"Paul C."}],"citation-key":"Ansari2019Use","container-title":"Optics Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

We show that the strategy of warping the multi-channel dense feature image at each iteration is more beneﬁcial than extracting features after warping the intensity image at each iteration. Motivated by this observation, we demonstrate robust and accurate alignment and ﬁtting performance using a variety of powerful feature descriptors.

Any insult to esophagus that causes replacement of normal squamous epithelium with columnar intestinal epithelium is labelled as the initiating event of the metaplasia–neoplasia sequence. Barrett’s esophagus is the precursor to EAC. Currently, endoscopically obtained biopsies are used to detect neoplastic changes in patients with Barrett’s esophagus (BE); however, it is not cost effective and hence a better screening modality is needed. Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) has been under study for the past few years and has shown promising results to overcome the shortcoming faced in the biopsy samplings. It is a second-generation optical coherence tomography (OCT) that provides high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of the esophageal mucosa using near-infrared light. The principle is similar to endosonography, but image formation in OCT depends on variations in the reflection of light from different tissue layers rather than ultrasonic waves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Aziz","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Fatima","given":"Rawish"}],"citation-key":"Aziz2018Future","container-title":"Clinical Journal of Gastroenterology","container-title-short":"Clin J Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.1007/s12328-018-0863-3","ISSN":"1865-7257, 1865-7265","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6]]},"language":"en","page":"179-183","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Future of diagnosing neoplasia in Barrett’s esophagus: volumetric laser endomicroscopy","title-short":"Future of diagnosing neoplasia in Barrett’s esophagus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12328-018-0863-3","volume":"11"},

Precise delineation of the benign lesion type and margins may have signiﬁcant public health implications in children. An innovative technology such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being explored to delineate pediatric benign laryngeal lesions. An accurate assessment of the subepithelial morphology may help towards tailoring more personalized therapeutic treatments. This study was established to highlight key morphological and optical features of benign pediatric laryngeal lesions using intraoperative OCT and to suggest clinical implications that arise from such optical imaging.\nMethods and materials: This in vivo study was performed at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Inﬁrmary. Intraoperative imaging was performed on twenty-ﬁve pediatric patients ranging from 1 year to 16 years of age presenting hoarseness. Three-dimensional OCT images of benign laryngeal lesions or a subsite of the lesion were acquired.\nResults: High-resolution OCT images of 25 patients with benign laryngeal lesions such as nodules, cysts, Reinke's edema, vocalis sulcus, and papilloma revealed distinct and speciﬁc morphological diﬀerences with normal tissue. Nodules show a symmetrical superﬁcial remodeling of the vocal fold epithelial layer and the basement membrane. Cysts have oval-like shape and are either superﬁcial or deeply located in the lamina propria. Sulcus vocalis OCT imaging allows characterizing if the lesion is shallow or deep according to Ford's classiﬁcation system. Reinke's edema of the mucosa can be observed and quantiﬁed, which may lead to suspicion on the underlying social and medical conditions. Finally, the ability to assess margins and depth of invasion of papilloma lesions is demonstrated, raising the possibility to use OCT with angiolytic lasers for patient-tailored treatments.\nConclusions: OCT imaging of benign pediatric vocal lesions is promising as it could improve preoperative decision-making and possibly peroperative imaging-guidance for patient-tailored treatments. An assessment of the optical contrast between healthy and abnormal tissue may help towards a more qualitative and quantitative approach to current standard care, especially when diagnosis remains unclear.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Benboujja","given":"Fouzi"},{"family":"Hartnick","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"Benboujja2018Clinical","container-title":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijporl.2018.08.036","ISSN":"01655876","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11]]},"language":"en","page":"111-119","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Clinical and surgical implications of intraoperative optical coherence tomography imaging for benign pediatric vocal fold lesions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016558761830449X","volume":"114"},
  {"id":"Benboujja2021Evaluation","abstract":"Objectives/Hypothesis: Identifying distinctive features of the vocal fold (VF) during development could have signiﬁcant clinical implications for treating voice disorders. This study investigates the structural organization of the VF microanatomy across gender and age groups using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Study Design: Prospective clinical trial. Materials and Methods: In vivo OCT images were acquired from 97 patients (58 males and 39 females) aged between 6 weeks and 27 years. All patients showed no signs of vocal fold pathology on endoscopy. Morphological features were extracted from OCT images and statistically compared between age groups. This study was performed at Massachusetts Eye and Ear between 2017 and 2019.\nResults: All OCT acquisitions show a stratiﬁed microanatomy across age groups, even in newborns suggesting the presence of a superﬁcial lamina propria (SLP) at birth. Furthermore, the optical scattering in the VF lamina propria changes according to age, suggesting subepithelial maturation. Although the epithelium thickness was relatively constant across age groups, the SLP showed a signiﬁcant linear relationship between age and thickness (P = .016). Furthermore, a signiﬁcant difference (P = .002) in SLP thickness was found between young adult males and females. The overall thickness of the entire mucosa did not change signiﬁcantly with age.\nConclusion: OCT is a noninvasive imaging modality capable of providing quantitative morphological features to describe the VF development. A stratiﬁed structure can be observed in OCT from newborns to young adults. Further investigations could combine OCT, acoustic measurements, and molecular sensitive techniques to provide a complete interpretation of the VF development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Benboujja","given":"Fouzi"},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Max"},{"family":"Nourmahnad","given":"Anahita"},{"family":"Rath","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Hartnick","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"Benboujja2021Evaluation","container-title":"The Laryngoscope","container-title-short":"The Laryngoscope","DOI":"10.1002/lary.29516","ISSN":"0023-852X, 1531-4995","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evaluation of the Human Vocal Fold Lamina Propria Development Using Optical Coherence Tomography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.29516","volume":"131"},
  {"id":"Bengs2020Spatiotemporal","abstract":"Purpose Localizing structures and estimating the motion of a speciﬁc target region are common problems for navigation during surgical interventions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality with a high spatial and temporal resolution that has been used for intraoperative imaging and also for motion estimation, for example, in the context of ophthalmic surgery or cochleostomy. Recently, motion estimation between a template and a moving OCT image has been studied with deep learning methods to overcome the shortcomings of conventional, feature-based methods.\nMethods We investigate whether using a temporal stream of OCT image volumes can improve deep learning-based motion estimation performance. For this purpose, we design and evaluate several 3D and 4D deep learning methods and we propose a new deep learning approach. Also, we propose a temporal regularization strategy at the model output.\nResults Using a tissue dataset without additional markers, our deep learning methods using 4D data outperform previous approaches. The best performing 4D architecture achieves an correlation coefﬁcient (aCC) of 98.58% compared to 85.0% of a previous 3D deep learning method. Also, our temporal regularization strategy at the output further improves 4D model performance to an aCC of 99.06%. In particular, our 4D method works well for larger motion and is robust toward image rotations and motion distortions.\nConclusions We propose 4D spatio-temporal deep learning for OCT-based motion estimation. On a tissue dataset, we ﬁnd that using 4D information for the model input improves performance while maintaining reasonable inference times. Our regularization strategy demonstrates that additional temporal information is also beneﬁcial at the model output.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bengs","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Gessert","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Schlüter","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Schlaefer","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"Bengs2020Spatiotemporal","container-title":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","container-title-short":"Int J CARS","DOI":"10.1007/s11548-020-02178-z","ISSN":"1861-6410, 1861-6429","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"en","page":"943-952","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spatio-temporal deep learning methods for motion estimation using 4D OCT image data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11548-020-02178-z","volume":"15"},

Since speed and and time are proportional quantities, knowing time-of-flight allows one to estimate distances. This time-of-flight may be attributed to a pulse of light or a wave packet of sound. Depending on the sub-band of the electromagnetic spectrum, the interaction of waves or pulses with the scene of interest results in measurements and based on this proxy of the physical world, one is interested in inferring physical properties of the scene. This may be something simple as depth, or something more involved such as fluorescence lifetime of a biological sample or the diffusion coefficient of turbid/scattering medium. The goal of this work is to develop a unifying approach to study time-resolved phenomena across various sub-bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, devise algorithms to solve for the corresponding inverse problems and provide fundamental limits. Sampling theory, which deals with the interplay between the discrete and the continuous realms, plays a critical role in this work due to the continuous nature of physical world and the discrete nature of its proxy, that is, the time-resolved measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhandari","given":"Ayush"}],"citation-key":"Bhandari2018Sampling","genre":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","license":"MIT theses may be protected by copyright.

  {"id":"Borghesan2018Single","abstract":"Vitreoretinal surgery concerns a set of particularly demanding minimal invasive micro-surgical interventions at the retina. Micro-surgeons are targeting sub-millimeter-sized structures here. Tiny vessels or wafer-thin membranes are to be cannulated or need to be peeled off. The greatest care is to be displayed not to damage these fragile structures or to inadvertently injure the underlying retina. Damage to the latter is mostly irreparable and might cause permanent loss of vision. Despite the availability over excellent stereo microscopes, wide-angle lenses and powerful light source visualization remains a problem. Especially, the limited depth perception is still perceived as a major bottle-neck whereas efforts have been conducted to integrate sensing capability in today’s state-of-the-art instruments, so far, little effort has been paid to process the obtained sensor data and turns this into a reliable source of information upon which robot assistive guidance schemes could be endowed upon. This paper proposes a number of processing techniques tailored to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) measurements. The first results of the proposed algorithms show that it is feasible to extract good and reliable distance estimates from this otherwise rather noisy signal and from a fairly limited dataset. The used data are the so-called A-scans. These are OCT measurements consisting of a single-line image that could be captured by an instrument-mounted fiber through which the OCT signal passes back-and-forth. However, in this work, we perform a pilot study whereby the employed A-scans are extracted from B-scans that are captured by a microscope-mounted OCT scanner, rather than obtained from a probe. The performance of a first embodiment of the algorithm that is based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is compared to the performance of a second embodiment that relies on a Particle Filter (PF), focusing on the issues in filter initialization and the tracking quality. Finally, results of UKF and PF executions on a validation dataset are presented.","author":[{"family":"Borghesan","given":"Gianni"},{"family":"Ourak","given":"Mouloud"},{"family":"Lankenau","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Hüttmann","given":"Gereon"},{"family":"Schulz-Hildebrandt","given":"Hinnerk"},{"family":"Willekens","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Stalmans","given":"P."},{"family":"Reynaerts","given":"Dominiek"},{"family":"Vander Poorten","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"Borghesan2018Single","container-title":"Journal of Medical Robotics Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Medical Robotics Research","DOI":"10.1142/S2424905X18400056","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,11]]},"page":"1840005","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Single Scan OCT-Based Retina Detection for Robot-Assisted Retinal Vein Cannulation","type":"article-journal","volume":"03"},

  {"id":"Bristow2016Defense","abstract":"In this chapter, we explore the surprising result that gradientbased continuous optimization methods perform well for the alignment of image/object models when using densely sampled sparse features (HOG, dense SIFT, etc.). Gradient-based approaches for image/object alignment have many desirable properties – inference is typically fast and exact, and diverse constraints can be imposed on the motion of points. However, the presumption that gradients predicted on sparse features would be poor estimators of the true descent direction has meant that gradient-based optimization is often overlooked in favour of graph-based optimization. We show that this intuition is only partly true: sparse features are indeed poor predictors of the error surface, but this has no impact on the actual alignment performance. In fact, for general object categories that exhibit large geometric and appearance variation, sparse features are integral to achieving any convergence whatsoever. How the descent directions are predicted becomes an important consideration for these descriptors. We explore a number of strategies for estimating gradients, and show that estimating gradients via regression in a manner that explicitly handles outliers improves alignment performance substantially. To illustrate the general applicability of gradient-based methods to the alignment of challenging object categories, we perform unsupervised ensemble alignment on a series of non-rigid animal classes from ImageNet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bristow","given":"Hilton"},{"family":"Lucey","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"Bristow2016Defense","container-title":"Dense Image Correspondences for Computer Vision","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-23048-1_7","editor":[{"family":"Hassner","given":"Tal"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ce"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-23047-4 978-3-319-23048-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"135-152","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"In Defense of Gradient-Based Alignment on Densely Sampled Sparse Features","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-23048-1_7"},
  {"id":"Britten2023Surgical","abstract":"Intraoperative optical coherence tomography is still not overly pervasive in routine ophthalmic surgery, despite evident clinical benefits. That is because today’s spectral-domain optical coherence tomography systems lack flexibility, acquisition speed, and imaging depth. We present to the best of our knowledge the most flexible swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) engine coupled to an ophthalmic surgical microscope that operates at MHz A-scan rates. We use a MEMS tunable VCSEL to implement application-specific imaging modes, enabling diagnostic and documentary capture scans, live B-scan visualizations, and real-time 4D-OCT renderings.

While coarse-to-ﬁne warping schemes have somehow relaxed this constraint, there is an inherent dependency between the scale of structures and the velocity that can be estimated. This particularly renders the estimation of detailed human motion problematic, as small body parts can move very fast. In this paper, we present a way to approach this problem by integrating rich descriptors into the variational optical ﬂow setting. This way we can estimate a dense optical ﬂow ﬁeld with almost the same high accuracy as known from variational optical ﬂow, while reaching out to new domains of motion analysis where the requirement of dense sampling in time is no longer satisﬁed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Brox","given":"T"},{"family":"Malik","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Brox2011Large","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"Cannon2021Layerbased","abstract":"Structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of tissue stand to benefit from greater functionalization and quantitative interpretation. The OCT attenuation coefficient µ, an analogue of the imaged sample’s scattering coefficient, offers potential functional contrast based on the relationship of µ to sub-resolution physical properties of the sample. Attenuation coefficients are computed either by fitting a representative µ over several depth-wise pixels of a sample’s intensity decay, or by using previously-developed depth-resolved attenuation algorithms by Girard et al. [Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 52, 7738 (2011). ] and Vermeer et al. [Biomed. Opt. Express 5, 322 (2014). ]. However, the former method sacrifices axial information in the tomogram, while the latter relies on the stringent assumption that the sample’s backscattering fraction, another optical property, does not vary along depth. This assumption may be violated by layered tissues commonly observed in clinical imaging applications. Our approach preserves the full depth resolution of the attenuation map but removes its dependence on backscattering fraction by performing signal analysis inside individual discrete layers over which the scattering properties (e.g., attenuation and backscattering fraction) vary minimally. Although this approach necessitates the detection of these layers, it removes the constant-backscattering-fraction assumption that has constrained quantitative attenuation coefficient analysis in the past, and additionally yields a layer-resolved backscattering fraction, providing complementary scattering information to the attenuation coefficient. We validate our approach using automated layer detection in layered phantoms, for which the measured optical properties were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated with Mie theory, and show preliminary results in tissue alongside corresponding histological analysis. Together, accurate backscattering fraction and attenuation coefficient measurements enable the estimation of both particle density and size, which is not possible from attenuation measurements alone. We hope that this improvement to depth-resolved attenuation coefficient measurement, augmented by a layer-resolved backscattering fraction, will increase the diagnostic power of quantitative OCT imaging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cannon","given":"Taylor M."},{"family":"Bouma","given":"Brett E."},{"family":"Uribe-Patarroyo","given":"Néstor"}],"citation-key":"Cannon2021Layerbased","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

We have proposed an intelligent theranostics method for a compact integrated diagnosis and therapeutic platform to automatically excise the brain tumor with high precision. To perform this operation, hardware combination of a benchtop spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and a high-power laser has been implemented by a customized fiber combiner. By the double-clad fiber out of the combiner which works as both the OCT sample arm fiber and the ablation laser output fiber, an in situ theranostics process without registration can be conducted. The SD-OCT image analysis from both en face and depth perspectives shows the structural information intuitively and accordingly generate the ablation-guiding grid. Based on the grid, the continuous wave high-power laser ablates ex vivo porcine brain models in submillimeter automatically. The feasibility of this theranostics method has been verified by the comparison of attenuation maps before and after ablation, and the contrast of its pathology.","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"W."},{"family":"Fan","given":"Y."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"X."},{"family":"Liao","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"Chang2018Intelligent","container-title":"2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","DOI":"10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513016","event-title":"2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","ISSN":"1558-4615","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7]]},"page":"3224-3227","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"An Intelligent Theranostics Method Using Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Automatic Laser Ablation for Neurosurgery","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"Chauffert2014Variable","abstract":"Reducing acquisition time is a crucial challenge for many imaging techniques. Compressed sensing (CS) theory oﬀers an appealing framework to address this issue since it provides theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction of sparse signals by projection on a low-dimensional linear subspace. In this paper, we focus on a setting where the imaging device allows us to sense a ﬁxed set of measurements. We ﬁrst discuss the choice of an optimal sampling subspace allowing perfect reconstruction of sparse signals. Its design relies on the random drawing of independent measurements. We discuss how to select the drawing distribution and show that a mixed strategy involving partial deterministic sampling and independent drawings can help in breaking the so-called coherence barrier. Unfortunately, independent random sampling is irrelevant for many acquisition devices owing to acquisition constraints. To overcome this limitation, the notion of a variable density sampler (VDS) is introduced and deﬁned as a stochastic process with a prescribed limit empirical measure. It encompasses samplers based on independent measurements or continuous curves. The latter are crucial to extend CS results to actual applications. We propose two original approaches to designing a continuous VDS, one based on random walks over the acquisition space and one based on the travelling salesman problem. Following theoretical considerations and retrospective CS simulations in magnetic resonance imaging, we intend to highlight the key properties of a VDS to ensure accurate sparse reconstructions, namely its limit empirical measure and its mixing time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Chauffert","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Ciuciu","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Kahn","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"Chauffert2014Variable","container-title":"SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences","container-title-short":"SIAM J.

The optical path length (OPL) of the Fabry-Pérot cavity can be modulated by a photothermal heating process, which was achieved by adjusting the power of a 650 nm heating laser. The optical heating process can eﬀectively change the thickness and refractive index of the polymer spacer of the sensor cavity. The robustness of the sensor can be greatly improved by proper packaging. The interferometer was interrogated by a relatively cheap wavelength-ﬁxed 1550 nm laser for broadband and sensitive ultrasound detection, eliminating the requirement for an expensive tunable interrogation laser. The sensing module was then integrated into a photoacoustic mesoscopic imaging system. Two phantom imaging experiments and an ex vivo imaging experiment demonstrated the capability of such a miniature sensor. The interferometer has an acoustic detection bandwidth of up to 30 MHz and a noise equivalent pressure of 40 mPa/Hz1/2 (i.e., 220 Pa over the full detection bandwidth).

  {"id":"Chen2021Transparent","abstract":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a hybrid imaging modality that uses ultrasound waves generated from light absorbing tissue chromophores to provide high spatial resolution and depth-resolved molecular information. However, conventional PAI setups involve complicated arrangement of optical components surrounding opaque ultrasound transducers to achieve a co-aligned optical illumination and ultrasound receiving field. This opacity of traditional ultrasound transducers impedes the miniaturization of the imaging head, besides precluding integration with other imaging modalities. To overcome these limitations, we recently fabricated a single element transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT) window using indium tin oxide (ITO) coated lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>) piezoelectric material and demonstrated its application for endoscopy and microscopy PAI applications. Extending on this work, we report new developments of TUTs to improve their detection bandwidth, sensitivity, and signal to noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining sufficient transparency. This includes investigating LiNbO<sub>3</sub> and PMN-PT as transparent piezoelectric materials with different matching layer designs.

  {"id":"Cheon2015Accurate","abstract":"This paper presents a novel intuitive targeting and tracking scheme that utilizes a common-path swept source optical coherence tomography (CP-SSOCT) distal sensor integrated handheld microsurgical tool. To achieve micron-order precision control, a reliable and accurate OCT distal sensing method is required; simultaneously, a prediction algorithm is necessary to compensate for the system delay associated with the computational, mechanical and electronic latencies. Due to the multilayered structure of retina, it is necessary to develop effective surface detection methods rather than simple peak detection. To achieve this, a shifted cross-correlation method is applied for surface detection in order to increase robustness and accuracy in distal sensing. A predictor based on Kalman filter was implemented for more precise motion compensation. The performance was first evaluated using an established dry phantom consisting of stacked cellophane tape. This was followed by evaluation in an ex-vivo bovine retina model to assess system accuracy and precision. The results demonstrate highly accurate depth targeting with less than 5 μm RMSE depth locking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheon","given":"Gyeong Woo"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Cha","given":"Jaepyeng"},{"family":"Gehlbach","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Kang","given":"Jin U."}],"citation-key":"Cheon2015Accurate","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"Choi2023Recent","abstract":"For decades now, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has been investigated to realize its potential as a niche biomedical imaging modality. Despite its highly desirable optical contrast and ultrasonic spatiotemporal resolution, PAI is challenged by such physical limitations as a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), diminished image contrast due to strong optical attenuation, and a lower-bound on spatial resolution in deep tissue. In addition, contrast-enhanced PAI has faced practical limitations such as insufficient cell-specific targeting due to low delivery efficiency and difficulties in developing clinically translatable agents. Identifying these limitations is essential to the continuing expansion of the field, and substantial advances in developing contrast-enhancing agents, complemented by highperformance image acquisition systems, have synergistically dealt with the challenges of conventional PAI. This review covers the past four years of research on pushing the physical and practical challenges of PAI in terms of SNR/contrast, spatial resolution, targeted delivery, and clinical application. Promising strategies for dealing with each challenge are reviewed in detail, and future research directions for next generation contrast-enhanced PAI are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Wonseok"},{"family":"Park","given":"Byullee"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Seongwook"},{"family":"Oh","given":"Donghyeon"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jongbeom"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Chulhong"}],"citation-key":"Choi2023Recent","container-title":"Chemical Reviews","container-title-short":"Chem.

In this work, we describe an optical imaging method to obtain high-resolution cross-sectional imaging using a paddle-shaped probe affixed to the endoscope tip.\nMethods  We integrated Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), an optical imaging method that produces cross-sectional images, into a paddle probe attached to video endoscope. We acquired images of esophageal epithelium from patients undergoing routine upper GI endoscopy. Images were classified by a reviewer blinded to patient identity and condition, and these results were compared with clinical diagnosis.\nResults  We successfully captured epithelial OCT images from 30 patients and identified features consistent with both squamous epithelium and Barrett’s esophagus. Our blinded image reviewer classified BE versus non-BE with 91.5% accuracy (65/71 image regions), including sensitivity of 84.6% for BE (11/13) and a specificity of 93.1% (54/58). However, in 16 patients, intubation of the probe into the esophagus could not be achieved.\nConclusions  A paddle probe is a feasible imaging format for acquiring cross-sectional OCT images from the esophagus and can provide a structural assessment of BE and non-BE tissue.

  {"id":"Cornelissen2019Realtime","abstract":"Depth perception remains a key challenge in vitreoretinal surgery. Currently users only have the view from an overhead stereo-microscope available, but this means of visualisation is quite restrictive. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has been introduced in the past and is even integrated in a number of commercial systems to provide a more detailed depth vision, even showing subsurface structures up to a few millimeters below the surface. The intra-operative use of OCT, especially in combination with robotics, is still sub-optimal. At present one can get either a very slowly updating large volume scan (C-scan) or a faster but not aligned cross-sectional B-scan or an even more local single point A-scan at very high update rate. In this work we propose a model-mediated approach. As the posterior eye segment can be approximated as a sphere, we propose to model the retina with this simplified sphere model, the center and radius of which can be estimated in real time. A time-varying Kalman filter is proposed here in combination with an instrument-integrated optical fiber that provides high-frequency A-scans along the longitudinal instrument direction. The model and convergence of the model has been validated first in a simulation environment and subsequently in-silico using an OCT A-scan probe mounted on a co-manipulated vitreoretinal robotic system. The probe was manipulated to measure a 3D stereo lithographically printed spherical model of the posterior eye segment. The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated in various scenarios. For the in-silico validation a 20 micrometer error and convergence speed of 2.0 seconds was found when sampling A-scans at 200Hz.","author":[{"family":"Cornelissen","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Ourak","given":"Mouloud"},{"family":"Borghesan","given":"Gianni"},{"family":"Reynaerts","given":"Dominiek"},{"family":"Poorten","given":"Emmanuel Vander"}],"citation-key":"Cornelissen2019Realtime","container-title":"2019 19th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","DOI":"10.1109/ICAR46387.2019.8981620","event-title":"2019 19th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"page":"666-672","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Towards Real-time Estimation of a Spherical Eye Model based on a Single Fiber OCT","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"Cox2009Challenges","abstract":"In recent years, some of the promised potential of biomedical photoacoustic imaging has begun to be realised. It has been used to produce good, three-dimensional, images of blood vasculature in mice and other small animals, and in human skin in vivo, to depths of several mm, while maintaining a spatial resolution of <100 μm. Furthermore, photoacoustic imaging depends for contrast on the optical absorption distribution of the tissue under study, so, in the same way that the measurement of optical spectra has traditionally provided a means of determining the molecular constituents of an object, there is hope that multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging will provide a way to distinguish and quantify the component molecules of optically-scattering biological tissue (which may include exogeneous, targeted, chromophores). In simple situations with only a few signiﬁcant absorbers and some prior knowledge of the geometry of the arrangement, this has been shown to be possible, but signiﬁcant hurdles remain before the general problem can be solved. The general problem may be stated as follows: is it possible, in general, to take a set of photoacoustic images obtained at multiple optical wavelengths, and process them in a way that results in a set of quantitatively accurate images of the concentration distributions of the constituent chromophores of the imaged tissue? If such an ‘inversion’ procedure not speciﬁc to any particular situation and free of restrictive suppositions - were designed, then photoacoustic imaging would oﬀer the possibility of high resolution ‘molecular’ imaging of optically scattering tissue: a very powerful technique that would ﬁnd uses in many areas of the life sciences and in clinical practice. This paper describes the principal challenges that must be overcome for such a general procedure to be successful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cox","given":"B.

However, these approaches typically rely on the pixel intensities for the alignment, which is prone to fail in presence of specularities or in absence of texture.

The introduction of WLI CE has motivated a wide range of research to improve its diagnostic capabilities through integration with other sensing modalities. These developments have the potential to overcome the limitations of WLI through enhanced detection of subtle mucosal microlesions and submucosal and/or transmural pathology , providing novel diagnostic avenues. Other research aims to utilize a range of sensors to measure physiological parameters or to discover new biomarkers to improve the sensitivity , specificity and thus the clinical utility of CE.

The ultrasound transducer is centered at 17.25 MHz, and shows ∼ 45% and ∼ 100% fractional bandwidths for ultrasound pulse-echo and photoacoustic Aline signals respectively. To achieve overall system portability, besides the imaging head, other back-end imaging system components need to be readily portable as well. In this direction, we have studied the potential use of compact preampliﬁers, scanning stages and microcontroller-based data acquisition and reconstruction for photoacoustic imaging.

  {"id":"Dedeoglu2007Asymmetry","abstract":"Most image registration problems are formulated in an asymmetric fashion. Given a pair of images, one is implicitly or explicitly regarded as a template and warped onto the other to match as well as possible. In this paper, we focus on this seemingly arbitrary choice of the roles and reveal how it may lead to biased warp estimates in the presence of relative scaling. We present a principled way of selecting the template and explain why only the correct asymmetric form, with the potential inclusion of a blurring step, can yield an unbiased estimator. We validate our analysis in the domain of model-based face tracking. We show how the usual Active Appearance Model (AAM) formulation overlooks the asymmetry issue, causing the fitting accuracy to degrade quickly when the observed objects are smaller than their model. We formulate a novel, “resolution-aware fitting” (RAF) algorithm that respects the asymmetry and incorporates an explicit model of the blur caused by the camera’s sensing elements into the fitting formulation. We compare the RAF algorithm against a state-ofthe-art tracker across a variety of resolutions and AAM complexity levels. Experimental results show that RAF significantly improves the estimation accuracy of both shape and appearance parameters when fitting to low-resolution data. Recognizing and accounting for the asymmetry of image registration leads to tangible accuracy improvements in analyzing low-resolution imagery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dedeoglu","given":"Goksel"},{"family":"Kanade","given":"Takeo"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"Dedeoglu2007Asymmetry","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"Deguchi2020Volumetric","abstract":"Dynamic biological systems present challenges to existing three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopes because of their continuous temporal and spatial changes. Most techniques are rigid in adapting the acquisition parameters over time, as in confocal microscopy, where a laser beam is sequentially scanned at a predeﬁned spatial sampling rate and pixel dwell time. Such lack of tunability forces a user to provide scan parameters, which may not be optimal, based on the best assumption before an acquisition starts. Here, we developed volumetric Lissajous confocal microscopy to achieve unsurpassed 3D scanning speed with a tunable sampling rate. The system combines an acoustic liquid lens for continuous axial focus translation with a resonant scanning mirror. Accordingly, the excitation beam follows a dynamic Lissajous trajectory enabling submillisecond acquisitions of image series containing 3D information at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. By temporal accumulation and/or advanced interpolation algorithms, the volumetric imaging rate is selectable using a post-processing step at the desired spatiotemporal resolution for events of interest. We demonstrate multicolor and calcium imaging over volumes of tens of cubic microns with 3D acquisition speeds of 30 Hz and frame rates up to 5 kHz.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Deguchi","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Bianchini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Palazzolo","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Oneto","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Diaspro","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Duocastella","given":"Martí"}],"citation-key":"Deguchi2020Volumetric","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"Dong2021Feasibility","abstract":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tethered capsule endomicroscopy (TCE) involves swallowing a small tethered pill that implements optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, procuring high resolution images of the whole esophagus. Here, we demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility and safety of TCE and a portable OCT imaging system in patients with Barrett’s esophagus (BE) in a multi-center (5-site) clinical study.\nMETHODS: Untreated patients with BE as per endoscopic biopsy diagnosis were eligible to participate in the study. TCE procedures were performed in unsedated patients by either doctors or nurses. After the capsule was swallowed, the device continuously obtained 10-mm-resolution crosssectional images as it traversed the esophagus. Following imaging, the device was withdrawn through mouth, and disinfected for subsequent reuse. BE lengths were compared to endoscopy ﬁndings when available. OCT-TCE images were compared to volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) images from a patient who had undergone VLE on the same day as TCE.\nRESULTS: 147 patients with BE were enrolled across all sites. 116 swallowed the capsule (79%), 95/114 (83.3%) men and 21/33 (63.6%) women (P [ .01). High-quality OCT images were obtained in 104/111 swallowers (93.7%) who completed the procedure. The average imaging duration was 5.55 – 1.92 minutes. The mean length of esophagus imaged per patient was 21.69 – 5.90 cm. A blinded comparison of maximum extent of BE measured by OCT-TCE and EGD showed a strong correlation (r [ 0.77-0.79).

The main objective is to reduce the acquisition time (i.e., increase the frame rate) of an OCT-scan system by choosing a trajectory that covers entirely the image but that does not take all the measurements. The reconstruction of the missing data is achieved by applying an updated Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) on a sparse representation of the image. Several sparse representations have been tested and the shearlets-based approach seems to outperform the other ones (e.g. wavelets, curvelets and by applying bilinear interpolation). The targeted application is a fast OCT imaging solution allowing an efﬁcient compensation of the artefacts induced by the patient physiological motions for diagnostic purpose through optical biopsies (3D micrometric resolution optical images). The obtained results seem promising in terms of low time processing and improvement of the quality of the reconstructed image compared to the traditional sparse acquisition.","author":[{"family":"Duflot","given":"Lesley-Ann"},{"family":"Krupa","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Tamadazte","given":"Brahim"},{"family":"Andreff","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"DuflotShearlet","language":"en","page":"4","source":"Zotero","title":"Shearlet transform: A good candidate for compressed sensing in optical coherence tomography","type":"article-journal"},

Lightsheet microscopy has emerged as the tool-of-choice for 3D characterization of rapidly evolving systems. However, to obtain a 3D image, either the sample or parts of the microscope are moved, limiting the acquisition speed. Here, we propose a novel inertia-free light-sheet-based scheme for volumetric imaging at high temporal resolution. Our approach comprises a novel combination of an acousto-optic scanner to produce tailored illumination and an acoustic-optoﬂuidic lens, placed in the detection path to provide extended depth-of-ﬁeld. Such a combination enables unsurpassed 3D imaging speeds up to 200 volumes per second. The volumetric imaging speed is limited only by the acquisition frame rate of the camera and the desired signal-to-noise ratio. Our volumetric microscope allows for invariant acquisition along the detection axis, avoiding extensive processing or complex deconvolution methods to restore image quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Duocastella","given":"Martí"},{"family":"Sancataldo","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Saggau","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Ramoino","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Bianchini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Diaspro","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"Duocastella2017Fast","container-title":"ACS Photonics","container-title-short":"ACS Photonics","DOI":"10.1021/acsphotonics.7b00382","ISSN":"2330-4022, 2330-4022","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,19]]},"language":"en","page":"1797-1804","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fast Inertia-Free Volumetric Light-Sheet Microscope","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.7b00382","volume":"4"},

In addition, several preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of combining intraoperative OCT imaging with novel image-processing and display methods to implement augmented/virtual reality and robotic surgical guidance platforms. While research and commercialization of these innovations have been largely driven by needs in ophthalmology, OCT is finding new clinical applications in surgical oncology and neurosurgery.

  {"id":"Factoring","abstract":"This article is essentially tutorial in nature. Weshow how any discrete wavelet transform or two band subbandfiltering withfinitefilters can be decomposed into afinite sequence of simplefiltering steps, which we call lifting steps but that are also known as ladder structures. This decomposition corresponds to afactorization of the polyphase matrix of the wavelet or subbandfilters into elementary matrices. That such a factorization is possible is well-known to algebraists (and expressed by the formula SL(n; R[Z, z-I]) = E(n; R[z, z-l])); it is also used in linear systems theory in the electrical engineering community. We present here a self-contained derivation, building the decomposition from basic principles such as the Euclidean algorithm, with a focus on applying it to waveletfiltering. This factorization provides an alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage that it can also be used in the biorthogonal, i.e., non-unitary case. Like the lattice factorization, the decomposition presented here asymptotically reduces the computational complexity of the transform by a factor two. It has other applications, such as the possibility of defining a wavelet-like transform that maps integers to integers.","citation-key":"Factoring","language":"en","page":"23","source":"Zotero","title":"Factoring wavelet transforms into lifting steps","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Fan2018Novel","abstract":"Purpose Complete resection of diseased lesions reduces the recurrence of cancer, making it critical for surgical treatment. However, precisely resecting residual tumors is a challenge during operation. A novel integrated spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT) and laser-ablation therapy system for soft-biological-tissue resection is proposed. This is a prototype optical integrated diagnosis and therapeutic system as well as an optical theranostics system. Methods We develop an optical theranostics system, which integrates SD-OCT, a laser-ablation unit, and an automatic scanning platform. The SD-OCT image of biological tissue provides an intuitive and clear view for intraoperative diagnosis and monitoring in real time. The effect of laser ablation is analyzed using a quantitative mathematical model. The automatic endoscopic scanning platform combines an endoscopic probe and an SD-OCT sample arm to provide optical theranostic scanning motion. An optical ﬁber and a chargecoupled device camera are integrated into the endoscopic probe, allowing detection and coupling of the OCT-aiming beam and laser spots.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Yingwei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Boyu"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xinran"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Hongen"}],"citation-key":"Fan2018Novel","container-title":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","container-title-short":"Int J CARS","DOI":"10.1007/s11548-017-1664-8","ISSN":"1861-6410, 1861-6429","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3]]},"language":"en","page":"411-423","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A novel integration of spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography and laser-ablation system for precision treatment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11548-017-1664-8","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"Fang2021Soft","abstract":"A compact and dexterous magnetic resonance (MR)–safe soft robot enables MR imaging–guided transoral laser microsurgery.\n          , \n            Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) provides compelling features for the guidance of interventional procedures, including high-contrast soft tissue imaging, detailed visualization of physiological changes, and thermometry. Laser-based tumor ablation stands to benefit greatly from MRI guidance because 3D resection margins alongside thermal distributions can be evaluated in real time to protect critical structures while ensuring adequate resection margins. However, few studies have investigated the use of projection-based lasers like those for transoral laser microsurgery, potentially because dexterous laser steering is required at the ablation site, raising substantial challenges in the confined MRI bore and its strong magnetic field. Here, we propose an MR-safe soft robotic system for MRI-guided transoral laser microsurgery. Owing to its miniature size (Ø12 × 100 mm), inherent compliance, and five degrees of freedom, the soft robot ensures zero electromagnetic interference with MRI and enables safe and dexterous operation within the confined oral and pharyngeal cavities. The laser manipulator is rapidly fabricated with hybrid soft and hard structures and is powered by microvolume (<0.004 milliter) fluid flow to enable laser steering with enhanced stiffness and lowered hysteresis. A learning-based controller accommodates the inherent nonlinear robot actuation, which was validated with laser path–following tests. Submillimeter laser steering accuracy was demonstrated with a mean error < 0.20 mm. MRI compatibility testing demonstrated zero observable image artifacts during robot operation. Ex vivo tissue ablation and a cadaveric head-and-neck trial were carried out under MRI, where we employed MR thermometry to monitor the tissue ablation margin and thermal diffusion intraoperatively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Fang","given":"Ge"},{"family":"Chow","given":"Marco C.

  {"id":"Farnell2019Total","abstract":"One of the fundamental assumptions of compressive sensing (CS) is that a signal can be reconstructed from a small number of samples by solving an optimization problem with the appropriate regularization term. Two standard regularization terms are the L1 norm and the total variation (TV) norm. We present a comparison of CS reconstruction results based on these two approaches in the context of chemical detection, and we demonstrate that optimization based on the L1 norm outperforms optimization based on the TV norm. Our comparison is driven by CS sampling, reconstruction, and chemical detection in two real-world datasets: the Physical Sciences Inc. Fabry-P´erot interferometer sensor multispectral dataset and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab FTIRbased longwave infrared sensor hyperspectral dataset. Both datasets contain the release of a chemical simulant such as glacial acetic acid, triethyl phosphate, and sulfur hexaﬂuoride. For chemical detection we use the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) and bulk coherence, and we propose algorithmic ACE thresholds to deﬁne the presence or absence of a chemical of interest in both un-compressed data cubes and reconstructed data cubes. The un-compressed data cubes provide an approximate ground truth. We demonstrate that optimization based on either the L1 norm or TV norm results in successful chemical detection at a compression rate of 90%, but we show that L1 optimization is preferable. We present quantitative comparisons of chemical detection on reconstructions from the two methods, with an emphasis on the number of pixels with an ACE value above the threshold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Farnell","given":"Elin"},{"family":"Kvinge","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Dupuis","given":"Julia R."},{"family":"Kirby","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Schundler","given":"Elizabeth C."}],"citation-key":"Farnell2019Total","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,25]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:1906.10603","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Total variation vs L1 regularization: a comparison of compressive sensing optimization methods for chemical detection","title-short":"Total variation vs L1 regularization","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10603"},

  {"id":"Francis2018Scattered","abstract":"Scattered data approximation refers to the computation of a multi-dimensional function from measurements obtained from scattered spatial locations. For this problem, the class of methods that adopt a roughness minimization are the best performing ones. These methods are called variational methods and they are capable of handling contrasting levels of sample density. These methods express the required solution as a continuous model containing a weighted sum of thin-plate spline or radial basis functions with centres aligned to the measurement locations, and the weights are speciﬁed by a linear system of equations. The main hurdle in this type of method is that the linear system is ill-conditioned. Further, getting the weights that are parameters of the continuous model representing the solution is only a part of the effort. Getting a regular grid image requires resampling of the continuous model, which is typically expensive. We develop a computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable method based on roughness minimization. The method leads to an algorithm that uses standard regular grid array operations only, which makes it attractive for parallelization. We demonstrate experimentally that we get these computational advantages only with a little compromise in performance when compared with thin-plate spline methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Francis","given":"Bibin"},{"family":"Viswanath","given":"Sanjay"},{"family":"Arigovindan","given":"Muthuvel"}],"citation-key":"Francis2018Scattered","container-title":"Sādhanā","container-title-short":"Sādhanā","DOI":"10.1007/s12046-017-0765-y","ISSN":"0256-2499, 0973-7677","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"5","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scattered data approximation by regular grid weighted smoothing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12046-017-0765-y","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"Francis2019Image","abstract":"We consider the problem of reconstructing 2D images from randomly under-sampled confocal microscopy samples. The well known and widely celebrated total variation regularization, which is the 1 norm of derivatives, turns out to be unsuitable for this problem; it is unable to handle both noise and under-sampling together. This issue is linked with the notion of phase transition phenomenon observed in compressive sensing research, which is essentially the break-down of total variation methods, when sampling density gets lower than certain threshold. The severity of this breakdown is determined by the so-called mutual incoherence between the derivative operators and measurement operator. In our problem, the mutual incoherence is low, and hence the total variation regularization gives serious artifacts in the presence of noise even when the sampling density is not very low. There has been very few attempts in developing regularization methods that perform better than total variation regularization for this problem. We develop a multi-resolution based regularization method that is adaptive to image structure. In our approach, the desired reconstruction is formulated as a series of coarse-to-fine multi-resolution reconstructions; for reconstruction at each level, the regularization is constructed to be adaptive to the image structure, where the information for adaption is obtained from the reconstruction obtained at coarser resolution level. This adaptation is achieved by using maximum entropy principle, where the required adaptive regularization is determined as the maximizer of entropy subject to the information extracted from the coarse reconstruction as constraints. We also utilize the directionally adaptive second order derivatives for constructing the regularization with directions guided by the given coarse reconstruction, which leads to an improved suppression of artifacts. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed regularization method over existing ones using several reconstruction examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Francis","given":"Bibin"},{"family":"Mathew","given":"Manoj"},{"family":"Arigovindan","given":"Muthuvel"}],"citation-key":"Francis2019Image","container-title":"Journal of Instrumentation","container-title-short":"J.

The possibility of obtaining spontaneous organization of separated components, whether they are molecules, polymers, nano- or micro-objects, into a larger functional unit, enables the development of ready-to-use plug and play devices and components at lower costs. Expanding the applicability of self-assembly approaches at the nanoscale to non-conventional substrates would open up new avenues towards multifunctional platforms customized for specific applications. Recently, the combination of the amazing morphological and optical features of self-assembled patterns with the intrinsic properties of optical fibers to conduct light to a remote location has demonstrated the potentiality to open up new intriguing scenarios featuring unprecedented functionalities and performances. The integration of advanced materials and structures at the nanoscale with optical fiber substrates is the idea behind the so-called lab-on-fiber technology, which is an emerging technology at the forefront of nanophotonics and nanotechnology research. Self-assembly processes can have a key role in implementing cost-effective solutions suitable for the mass production of technologically advanced platforms based on optical fibers towards their real market exploitation.

  {"id":"Garcia2016Collagen","abstract":"Objective. Vocal fold scarring, a condition defined by increased collagen content, is challenging to treat without a method of noninvasively assessing vocal fold structure in vivo. The goal of this study was to observe the effects of vocal fold collagen content on optical coherence tomography imaging to develop a quantifiable marker of disease. Study Design. Excised specimen study. Setting. Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Subjects and Methods. Porcine vocal folds were injected with collagenase to remove collagen from the lamina propria. Optical coherence tomography imaging was performed preinjection and at 0, 45, 90, and 180 minutes postinjection. Mean pixel intensity (or image brightness) was extracted from images of collagenase- and control-treated hemilarynges. Texture analysis of the lamina propria at each injection site was performed to extract image contrast. Twofactor repeated measure analysis of variance and t tests were used to determine statistical significance. Picrosirius red staining was performed to confirm collagenase activity.\nResults. Mean pixel intensity was higher at injection sites of collagenase-treated vocal folds than control vocal folds (P \\ .0001). Fold change in image contrast was significantly increased in collagenase-treated vocal folds than control vocal folds (P = .002).

  {"id":"Garcia2016Using","abstract":"Objectives/Hypothesis: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising technology to noninvasively assess vocal fold microanatomy. The goal of this study was to develop a methodology using OCT to identify quantifiable markers of vocal fold development. Study Design: In vivo study.\nMethods: A two-step process was developed to reproducibly image the midmembranous vocal fold edge of 10 patients younger than 2 years and 10 patients between 11 and 16 years of age using OCT. An image analysis algorithm was implemented to extract OCT-derived A-lines for each patient. These A-lines were divided into three zones according to apparent changes in slope. Relative attenuation coefficients, or tissue- and system-dependent parameters that describe the rate at which optical signal decays, were calculated for each zone.\nResults: Young patients had distinct relative attenuation coefficients in zone 1 (P < .0001), whereas zones 2 and 3 were indistinct (P 5 .1129). Older patients had distinct relative attenuation coefficients in zones 1, 2, and 3 (P < .0370). Between age groups, relative attenuation coefficients were different in zones 2 and 3 (P < .0001, P 5 .0315, respectively) and indistinct in zone 1 (P 5 .1438).\nConclusions: Relative attenuation coefficients can be used as markers of vocal fold development. Differences in relative attenuation coefficients likely represent changes in extracellular matrix structure within the lamina propria and may become useful for guiding treatment of voice disorders in the pediatric population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia","given":"Jordan A."},{"family":"Benboujja","given":"Fouzi"},{"family":"Beaudette","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Boudoux","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Hartnick","given":"Christopher J."}],"citation-key":"Garcia2016Using","container-title":"The Laryngoscope","container-title-short":"The Laryngoscope","DOI":"10.1002/lary.25765","ISSN":"0023852X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"E218-E223","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using attenuation coefficients from optical coherence tomography as markers of vocal fold maturation: Studying Vocal Fold Maturation With OCT","title-short":"Using attenuation coefficients from optical coherence tomography as markers of vocal fold maturation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.25765","volume":"126"},
  {"id":"GeraldesMEMS","abstract":"Today, lasers are used in many surgical procedures due to their ability of performing precise incisions, and ablations. With the development of ﬁber-coupled lasers, even minimally invasive procedures started making use of laser tools. However, existing ﬁber tools do not provide the same performance as traditional laser systems, often causing signiﬁcantly more tissue carbonization. This can be attributed to the lack of optics in ﬁber tools, which requires the tip of the ﬁber to be placed in direct contact with the tissue, increasing the collateral damage of the laser. To avoid this issue, a compact focusing system should be integrated in the ﬁber tool. However, traditional optical systems based on moving lenses are too large and bulky for that. To solve this problem, this thesis proposes a focusing system based on MEMS deformable mirrors. Using microfabrication methods, we develop a novel MEMS varifocal mirror, designed for focusing high-power laser in a ﬁber laser system. The design of this mirror is based on state-of-the-art MEMS deformable mirrors, which have been proposed for microscopy applications, with signiﬁcant adaptations for high-power lasers, including different actuation mechanisms and control strategies. We explore the use of hydraulic actuation to achieve large focal length range, while providing compatibility with high-power laser. The deﬂection of the mirror is controlled using a feed-forward model, in which parameters are obtained through characterization of the fabrication process. This allows controlling the mirror without a beam splitter or external sensors, which contributes to the miniaturization of the focusing system.","author":[{"family":"Geraldes","given":"Andre Augusto"}],"citation-key":"GeraldesMEMS","language":"en","page":"139","source":"Zotero","title":"MEMS Varifocal Mirror for High-Power Laser Focusing","type":"article-journal"},

In addition, we employ numerical simulations to obtain the theoretically achievable precision and accuracy of the estimated parameters under various experimental conditions. Finally, the method is applied to two sets of measurements obtained from a multi-layer phantom by two experimental OCT systems: one with a large and one with a small Rayleigh length.

  {"id":"Golkar2021Hybrid","abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common ophthalmic disease among diabetic patients. It is essential to diagnose DR in the early stages of treatment. Various imaging systems have been proposed to detect and visualize retina diseases. The fluorescein angiography (FA) imaging technique is now widely used as a gold standard technique to evaluate the clinical manifestations of DR. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is another technique that provides 3D information of the retinal structure. The FA and OCT images are captured in two different phases and field of views and image fusion of these modalities are of interest to clinicians. This paper proposes a hybrid registration framework based on the extraction and refinement of segmented major blood vessels of retinal images. The newly extracted features significantly improve the success rate of global registration results in the complex blood vessel network of retinal images. Afterward, intensity-based and deformable transformations are utilized to further compensate the motion magnitude between the FA and OCT images. Experimental results of 26 images of the various stages of DR patients indicate that this algorithm yields promising registration and fusion results for clinical routine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Golkar","given":"Ehsan"},{"family":"Rabbani","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Dehghani","given":"Alireza"}],"citation-key":"Golkar2021Hybrid","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

Its optical performance makes it particularly attractive for outpatient care use in the optical detection of tissue pathologies inside of the bladder. The use of a tubular piezoelectric-based ﬁber scanner allows for forward-looking 3D imaging with a single ﬁber, which can be operated in a quasi-resonant regime to provide a large scanning range with relatively low driving voltages, while maintaining a small outer diameter. This conﬁguration and the adjustable scanning rate of the ﬁber allow for not only high-resolution OCT images, but also the potential implementation of functional extensions like OCT Angiography. Commercially available focusing optics are used at the tip of the probe, which is designed for telecentric operation in contact with the tissue. The coupling parts, as well as the probe housing, are produced using selective laser-induced etching of fused silica, a 3D structuring approach that enables the creation of alignment and pinning features with micrometer precision. The use of this technology allows for ﬁnely tuned optical and mechanical designs, while facilitating the mounting and interconnection of components, providing a reliable assembly process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"González-Cerdas","given":"Gerardo E."},{"family":"Stein","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Kretschmer","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Sandic","given":"Dragan"},{"family":"Ataman","given":"Caglar"},{"family":"Zappe","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"Gonzalez-Cerdas2020Microstructured","container-title":"Biomedical Spectroscopy, Microscopy, and Imaging","DOI":"10.1117/12.2555069","editor":[{"family":"Popp","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Gergely","given":"Csilla"}],"event-place":"Online Only, France","event-title":"Biomedical Spectroscopy, Microscopy, and Imaging","ISBN":"978-1-5106-3490-9 978-1-5106-3491-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,13]]},"language":"en","page":"17","publisher":"SPIE","publisher-place":"Online Only, France","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Micro-structured glass probe for endoscopic Optical Coherence Tomography","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11359/2555069/Micro-structured-glass-probe-for-endoscopic-Optical-Coherence-Tomography/10.1117/12.2555069.full"},

  {"id":"Gutierrez-Barragan2022Compressive","abstract":"Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging pixel technology for time-of-flight (ToF) 3D cameras that can capture the time-of-arrival of individual photons at picosecond resolution. To estimate depths, current SPADbased 3D cameras measure the round-trip time of a laser pulse by building a per-pixel histogram of photon timestamps. As the spatial and timestamp resolution of SPADbased cameras increase, their output data rates far exceed the capacity of existing data transfer technologies. One major reason for SPAD’s bandwidth-intensive operation is the tight coupling that exists between depth resolution and histogram resolution. To weaken this coupling, we propose compressive single-photon histograms (CSPH). CSPHs are a per-pixel compressive representation of the high-resolution histogram, that is built on-the-fly, as each photon is detected. They are based on a family of linear coding schemes that can be expressed as a simple matrix operation. We design different CSPH coding schemes for 3D imaging and evaluate them under different signal and background levels, laser waveforms, and illumination setups. Our results show that a well-designed CSPH can consistently reduce data rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude without compromising depth precision.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gutierrez-Barragan","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Ingle","given":"Atul"},{"family":"Seets","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Mohit"},{"family":"Velten","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"Gutierrez-Barragan2022Compressive","container-title":"2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01733","event-place":"New Orleans, LA, USA","event-title":"2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","ISBN":"978-1-66546-946-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"language":"en","page":"17833-17843","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"New Orleans, LA, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Compressive Single-Photon 3D Cameras","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9878523/"},

Since it is invariant under monotonically increasing grey value transformations, it forms the basis of an illumination-robust constancy assumption. However, its underlying mathematical concepts have not been studied so far. The goal of our paper is to provide this missing theoretical foundation. We study the continuous limit of the inherently discrete census transform and embed it into a variational setting. Our analysis shows two surprising results: The census-based technique enforces matchings of extrema, and it induces an anisotropy in the data term by acting along level lines.

To improve throughput, compressive imaging under-samples image signals; the images are then computationally reconstructed by solving a regularized inverse problem. Compared to traditional regularizers, Deep Learning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image quality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the compression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising the reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose differentiable compressive ﬂuorescence microscopy (∂µ) which includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnablephysical parameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse model. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal compressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we performed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope conﬁgurations. Our results suggest that learned sampling outperforms widely used traditional compressive sampling schemes at higher compressions (×100 − 1000) in terms of reconstruction quality.

  {"id":"Hariri2009Laparoscopic","abstract":"Objectives—Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the US largely due to late detection secondary to unreliable symptomology and screening tools without adequate resolution. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recently emerging imaging modality with promise in ovarian cancer diagnostics, providing non-destructive subsurface imaging at imaging depths up to 2 mm with near-histological grade resolution (10–20 μm). In this study, we developed the first ever laparoscopic OCT (LOCT) device, evaluated the safety and feasibility of LOCT, and characterized the microstructural features of human ovaries in vivo.\nMethods—A custom LOCT device was fabricated specifically for laparoscopic imaging of the ovaries in patients undergoing oophorectomy. OCT images were compared with histopathology to identify preliminary architectural imaging features of normal and pathologic ovarian tissue.\nResults—Thirty ovaries in 17 primarily peri or post-menopausal women were successfully imaged with LOCT: 16 normal, 5 endometriosis, 3 serous cystadenoma, and 4 adenocarcinoma. Preliminary imaging features developed for each category reveal qualitative differences in the homogeneous character of normal post-menopausal ovary, the ability to image small subsurface inclusion cysts, and distinguishable features for endometriosis, cystadenoma, and adenocarcinoma.\nConclusions—We present the development and successful implementation of the first laparoscopic OCT probe. Comparison of OCT images and corresponding histopathology allowed for the description of preliminary microstructural features for normal ovary, endometriosis, and benign and malignant surface epithelial neoplasms. These results support the potential of OCT both as a diagnostic tool and imaging modality for further evaluation of ovarian cancer pathogenesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hariri","given":"Lida P."},{"family":"Bonnema","given":"Garret T."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"Amy M."},{"family":"Korde","given":"Vrushali"},{"family":"Hatch","given":"Kenneth D."},{"family":"Davis","given":"John R."},{"family":"Brewer","given":"Molly A."},{"family":"Barton","given":"Jennifer K."}],"citation-key":"Hariri2009Laparoscopic","container-title":"Gynecologic Oncology","container-title-short":"Gynecologic Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.05.014","ISSN":"00908258","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8]]},"language":"en","page":"188-194","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Laparoscopic optical coherence tomography imaging of human ovarian cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090825809003436","volume":"114"},

  {"id":"He2019Speeding","abstract":"Raman imaging is a promising technique that allows the spatial distribution of diﬀerent components in the sample to be obtained using the molecular ﬁngerprint information on individual species. However, the imaging speed is the bottleneck for the current Raman imaging methods to monitor the dynamic process of living cells. In this paper, we developed an artiﬁcial intelligence assisted fast Raman imaging method over the already fast line scan Raman imaging method. The reduced imaging time is realized by widening the slit and laser beam, and scanning the sample with a large scan step. The imaging quality is improved by a data-driven approach to train a deep convolutional neural network, which statistically learns to transform low-resolution images acquired at a high speed into high-resolution ones that previously were only possible with a low imaging speed. Accompanied with the improvement of the image resolution, the deteriorated spectral resolution as a consequence of a wide slit is also restored, thereby the ﬁdelity of the spectral information is retained. The imaging time can be reduced to within 1 min, which is about ﬁve times faster than the state-of-the-art line scan Raman imaging techniques without sacriﬁcing spectral and spatial resolution. We then demonstrated the reliability of the current method using ﬁxed cells. We ﬁnally used the method to monitor the dynamic evolution process of living cells. Such an imaging speed opens a door to the label-free observation of cellular events with conventional Raman microscopy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Mengxi"},{"family":"Zong","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Lilan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Bin"}],"citation-key":"He2019Speeding","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"Higuma2015Combined","abstract":"OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the incidence of plaque rupture (PR), plaque erosion (PE), and calciﬁed nodule (CN) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); to compare detailed morphologic plaque characteristics of PR, PE, and CN with optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound; and to compare the post-procedure outcomes among PR, PE, and CN.\nBACKGROUND The incidence and detailed morphologic characteristics of PR, PE, and CN in STEMI patients and their outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are unknown.\nMETHODS A total of 112 STEMI patients who underwent PCI within 12 h from symptom onset were included. Both optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound were performed following aspiration thrombectomy.\nRESULTS The incidence of PR, PE, and CN was 64.3%, 26.8%, and 8.0%, respectively. PE and CN, compared with PR, had more ﬁbrous plaque (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) and less thin-cap ﬁbroatheroma (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) as well as smaller plaque burden (p ¼ 0.003 and p ¼ 0.001) and remodeling index (p ¼ 0.003 and p < 0.001). PE had greater plaque eccentricity index than PR and CN (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). CN had greater calciﬁed arc and shallower calcium than PR (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) or PE (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). More than one-half of CN had negative remodeling. PE had a lower incidence of no-reﬂow phenomenon after PCI than PR (p ¼ 0.011).\nCONCLUSIONS PE was the underlying mechanism in one-fourth of STEMI. PE was characterized by eccentric ﬁbrous plaque. CN was characterized by superﬁcial large calcium and negative remodeling. PE was associated with less microvascular damage after PCI.

Towards enabling clinical use, we successfully reduced the dimensions of our earlier 18-mm microsurgery probe by half, while improving optical performance. We use analytical and computational models to optimize the miniaturized lens system for off-axis scanning aberrations. The optimization reveals that the optical system can be aberration-corrected using simple aspheric relay lenses to achieve diffraction-limited imaging resolution over a large field of view. Before moving forward with custom lenses, we have constructed the 9.6-mm probe using off-the-shelf spherical relay lenses and a 0.55 NA aspheric objective lens. In addition to reducing the diameter by nearly 50% and the total volume by 5 times, we also demonstrate improved lateral and axial resolutions of 1.27 µm and 13.5 µm, respectively, compared to 1.64 µm and 16.4 µm in our previous work. Using this probe, we can successfully image various tissue samples, such as rat tail tendon that required 2-3 × lower laser power than the current state-of-the-art.

  {"id":"Hu2021Fast","abstract":"CARCI is a fast confocal Raman imaging system using brightfield images to define the sample ROI, which is imaged 5×–10× faster using compressive sensing. This allowed 98 yeast cells to be imaged in a time a traditional system could only measure 20.\n          , \n            Raman hyperspectral imaging is a powerful method to obtain detailed chemical information about a wide variety of organic and inorganic samples noninvasively and without labels. However, due to the weak, nonresonant nature of spontaneous Raman scattering, acquiring a Raman imaging dataset is time-consuming and inefficient. In this paper we utilize a compressive imaging strategy coupled with a context-aware image prior to improve Raman imaging speed by 5- to 10-fold compared to classic point-scanning Raman imaging, while maintaining the traditional benefits of point scanning imaging, such as isotropic resolution and confocality. With faster data acquisition, large datasets can be acquired in reasonable timescales, leading to more reliable downstream analysis. On standard samples, context-aware Raman compressive imaging (CARCI) was able to reduce the number of measurements by ∼85% while maintaining high image quality (SSIM >0.85). Using CARCI, we obtained a large dataset of chemical images of fission yeast cells, showing that by collecting 5-fold more cells in a given experiment time, we were able to get more accurate chemical images, identification of rare cells, and improved biochemical modeling. For example, applying VCA to nearly 100 cells’ data together, cellular organelles were resolved that were not faithfully reconstructed by a single cell's dataset.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Chuanzhen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xianli"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Chuanhai"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Kaiqin"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Zachary J."}],"citation-key":"Hu2021Fast","container-title":"The Analyst","container-title-short":"Analyst","DOI":"10.1039/D1AN00088H","ISSN":"0003-2654, 1364-5528","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"2348-2357","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fast confocal Raman imaging <i>via</i> context-aware compressive sensing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D1AN00088H","volume":"146"},

We compare our findings with histopathology as the gold standard. Irradiated mice receive a single dose of 40 Gy at proximal and distal spots of the esophagus of 10.0 mm in diameter. We scan mice using OCT at two, three, and seven days post-irradiation. In OCT analysis, we define ARIED as a presence of distorted esophageal layering, change in backscattering signal properties, or change in the esophageal wall thickness. The average esophageal wall thickness is 0.53 mm larger on OCT when ARIED is present based on histopathology. The overall sensitivity and specificity of OCT to detect ARIED compared to histopathology are 94% and 47%, respectively. However, the overall sensitivity of OCT to assess ARIED is 100% seven days post-irradiation. We validate the capability of OCT to detect ARIED induced by high doses in mice.

  {"id":"Jivraj2018Smart","abstract":"Real-time depth metrology during material removal via laser ablation is useful in many forms of laser machining. Until now, coaxial optical coherence tomography (OCT) metrology was achieved by the coupling of an OCT imaging beam and ablating beams using a dichroic ﬁlter. We present an alternative design with all ﬁber delivery that is more suitable for surgical laser ablation applications. The novel system design integrates a high peak-power pulsed Yb-doped ﬁber laser (1064nm) coupled directly into the sample arm of a swept-source OCT system (λc = 1310nm). We measured the OCT signal degradation due to dispersion and attenuation through the ablation ﬁber laser cavity. Ablation progression is measured in real-time using M-mode OCT. The mean depth targeting error was found to range from 10µm to 80µm in phantom ablation experiments and 21µm to 60µm in bone ablation. A number of issues have been solved, including point-spread function (PSF) peak broadening due to signal delay and dispersion, high bending loss due to dissimilar ﬁber used throughout the design, and problems due to the extremely high ablation power to swept-source power ratio (> 2x104 peak to average power). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration of thermal-mediated laser ablation drilling integrated with coaxial OCT imaging through a single-mode, single-cladded output ﬁber, without using dichroic beam splitters or free-space optic ﬁlters anywhere in the optical path and with this high ablation laser power to OCT source power ratio. The removal of bulk optics compared to existing designs opens a new path for compact integration of the entire system. Also, since the ablation laser and OCT feedback system exist along the same ﬁber path, the need for maintenance and repair are greatly reduced since spatial beam alignment and the potential open-air contamination of optical surfaces are virtually eliminated. We believe that this integrated system is a great candidate for adoption in depth-controlled surgical ablation applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jivraj","given":"Jamil"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chaoliang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yize"},{"family":"Ramjist","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Vuong","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Xijia"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Victor X.

Due in part to the simplicity and robustness of its design, Fourier domain CP-OCT (FD-CP-OCT) offers advantages in many endoscopic sensing and imaging applications. FD-CP-OCT uses simple, interchangeable ﬁber optic probes that are easily integrated into small and delicate surgical tools. The system is capable of providing not only high-resolution imaging but also optical sensing. Here, we report progress towards practical application of FD-CP-OCT in the setting of delicate microsurgical procedures such as intraocular retinal surgery. To meet the challenges presented by the microsurgical requirements of these procedures, we have developed and initiated the validation of applicable ﬁber optic probes. By integrating these probes into our developing imaging system, we have obtained high-resolution OCT images and have also completed a demonstration of their potential sensing capabilities. Speciﬁcally, we utilize multiple superluminescent diodes to demonstrate sub-3-µm axial resolution in water; we propose a technique to quantitatively evaluate the spatial distribution of oxygen saturation levels in tissue; and we present evidence supportive of the technology’s surface sensing and tool guidance potential by demonstrating topological and motion compensation capabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"J U"},{"literal":"Jae-Ho Han"},{"literal":"Xuan Liu"},{"literal":"Kang Zhang"},{"literal":"Chul Gyu Song"},{"family":"Gehlbach","given":"P"}],"citation-key":"Kang2010Endoscopic","container-title":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","container-title-short":"IEEE J.

  {"id":"KatoNonculprit","abstract":"Background—Chronic kidney disease (CKD) promotes the development of atherosclerosis and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to compare the coronary plaque characteristics of patients with and without CKD using optical coherence tomography.\nMethods and Results—We identified 463 nonculprit plaques from 287 patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) optical coherence tomography registry. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. A total of 402 plaques (250 patients) were in the non-CKD group and 61 plaques (37 patients) were in the CKD group. Compared with non-CKD plaques, plaques with CKD had a larger lipid index (mean lipid arc×lipid length, 1248.4±782.8 mm° [non-CKD] versus 1716.1±1116.2 mm° [CKD]; P=0.003). Fibrous cap thickness was not significantly different between the groups.

  {"id":"Katta2018Optical","abstract":"Background and Objective: Surgical oncology can beneﬁt from specialized tools that enhance imaging and enable precise cutting and removal of tissue without damage to adjacent structures. The combination of highresolution, fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) coaligned with a nanosecond pulsed thulium (Tm) laser offers advantages over conventional surgical laser systems. Tm lasers provide superior beam quality, high volumetric tissue removal rates with minimal residual thermal footprint in tissue, enabling a reduction in unwanted damage to delicate adjacent sub-surface structures such as nerves or microvessels. We investigated such a combined Tm/OCT system with co-aligned imaging and cutting beams—a conﬁguration we call a “smart laser knife.”\nMethods: A blow-off model that considers absorption coefﬁcients and beam delivery systems was utilized to predict Tm cut depth, tissue removal rate and spatial distribution of residual thermal injury. Experiments were performed to verify the volumetric removal rate predicted by the model as a function of average power. A bench-top, combined Tm/OCT system was constructed using a 15W 1940 nm nanosecond pulsed Tm ﬁber laser (500 mJ pulse energy, 100 ns pulse duration, 30 kHz repetition rate) for removing tissue and a swept source laser (1310 Æ 70 nm, 100 kHz sweep rate) for OCT imaging. Tissue phantoms were used to demonstrate precise surgery with blood vessel avoidance. Depth imaging informed cutting/removal of targeted tissue structures by the Tm laser was performed.\nResults: Laser cutting was accomplished around and above phantom blood vessels while avoiding damage to vessel walls. A tissue removal rate of 5.5 mm3/sec was achieved experimentally, in comparison to the model prediction of approximately 6 mm3/sec.\nConclusion: We describe a system that combines OCT and laser tissue modiﬁcation with a Tm laser. Simulation results of the tissue removal rate using a simple model, as a function of average power, are in good agreement with experimental results using tissue phantoms. Lasers Surg.

  {"id":"Katta2019Laser","abstract":"Methods: A fluorescent human glioblastoma cell line was injected into mice and allowed to grow four weeks. Craniotomies were performed and tumors were imaged with confocal fluorescence microscopy. The mice were subsequently OCT imaged prior, during and after laser coagulation and/or ablation. The prior OCT images were used to compute three-dimensional tumor margin and angiography images, which guided the coagulation and ablation steps. Histology of the treated regions was then compared to post-treatment OCT images.\nResults: Tumor sizing based on OCT margin detection matched histology to within experimental error. Although fluorescence microscopy imaging showed the tumors were collocated with OCT imaging, margin assessment using confocal microscopy failed to see the extent of the tumor beyond ~ 250 µm in depth, as verified by OCT and histology. The two-laser approach to surgery utilizing Tm wavelength for coagulation and Er:YAG for ablation yielded bloodless resection of tumor regions with minimal residual damage as seen in histology.\nConclusion: Precise and bloodless tumor resection under OCT image guidance is demonstrated in the murine xenograft brain cancer model.

Two-dimensional imaging of an object is demonstrated by simultaneously rotating the object while scanning across its diameter. Illumination light from the optical core of the fiber cantilever is projected through a lens onto the object. Reflected light is collected by the same lens and projected onto a photodetector. An image of the object is reconstructed by interpolation of the detected signal. The resolution of the system was measured to be 16μm by imaging a resolution target.

In this study, we built a flexible endoscopic µOCT probe with an outer diameter of 1.2 mm, which acquires three-dimensional images of the arterial microstructures via helical scanning with an axial and lateral resolutions of 1.83 µm and 3.38 µm in air, respectively. Furthermore, the depth of focus of the µOCT imaging probe was extended two-fold using a binary phase spatial filter. We demonstrated that the present endoscopic µOCT could image cellular level features of a rabbit artery with high-risk atheroma and a bioresorbable scaffold-implanted swine coronary artery. This highly-translatable endoscopic µOCT will be a useful tool for investigating coronary artery disease and stent biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Junyoung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sunwon"},{"family":"Song","given":"Joon Woo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyun Jung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Min Woo"},{"family":"Han","given":"Jeongmoo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jin Won"},{"family":"Yoo","given":"Hongki"}],"citation-key":"Kim2020Flexible","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-65742-2","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"9248","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Flexible endoscopic micro-optical coherence tomography for three-dimensional imaging of the arterial microstructure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65742-2","volume":"10"},

In this study, we developed a 3.38-mm diameter catheter-based, integrated optical-resolution photoacoustic and ultrasonic mini-probe system and successfully demonstrated its intra-instrument channel workability for the standard 3.7-mm diameter instrument channel of a clinical video endoscope based on a swine model. Through the instrument channel, we acquired the first in vivo photoacoustic and ultrasonic dual-mode endoscopic images from the esophagogastric junction, which is one of the most frequently cited anatomical sites in the gastrointestinal tract in relation to Barrett’s esophagus.

  {"id":"Kim2021Wide","abstract":"In the past few decades, video endoscopy has become one of the primary medical devices in diverse clinical ﬁelds for examination, treatment, and early disease diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract. For an accurate diagnosis, an endoscopic camera offering bright and wide ﬁeld-of-view images is required while maintaining its compact dimensions to enter the long, narrow, and dark tract inside of the body. Recent endoscopic lenses successfully provide wide ﬁelds-of-view and have compact sizes for the system; however, their f-numbers still remain at 2.8 or higher. Therefore, further improvement in f-numbers is required to compensate for the restricted illumination system of the endoscopic probe. Here, we present a low f-number endoscopic lens design while providing wide ﬁeld-of-view and high-resolution imaging. The proposed lens system achieved a low f-number of 2.2 and a ﬁeld-of-view of 140 deg. The modulation transfer function (MTF) is over 20% at 180 lp/mm, and relative illumination is more than 60% in the full ﬁeld. Additionally, the proposed lens is designed for a 1/4” 5-megapixel complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor with a pixel size of 1.4 µm. This all-plastic lens design could help develop a high-performance disposable endoscope that prevents the risk of infection or cross-contamination with mass manufacture and low cost.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Dongmok"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Sehui"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Hyuk-Sang"}],"citation-key":"Kim2021Wide","container-title":"Photonics","container-title-short":"Photonics","DOI":"10.3390/photonics8040089","ISSN":"2304-6732","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]]},"language":"en","page":"89","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Wide Field-of-View, High-Resolution Endoscopic Lens Design with Low F-Number for Disposable Endoscopy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6732/8/4/89","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Kobler2010Dynamic","abstract":"Objectives/Hypothesis—Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide high-resolution (~10–15 μm/pixel) images of vocal fold microanatomy, as demonstrated previously. We explored physiologically triggered Fourier-domain OCT for imaging vocal folds during phonation. The goal is to visualize dynamic histological cross sections and four-dimensional data sets where multiple planes are displayed in synchronized motion. If feasible, this approach could be a useful research tool and spur development of new clinical instrumentation. Study Design—A Fourier-domain, triggered OCT system was created and tested in experiments on excised calf larynges to obtain preliminary observations and characterize important factors affecting image quality.\nMethods—Larynges were imaged during phonation driven by warm, humidified air. A subglottal pressure signal was used to synchronize the OCT system with the phonatory cycle. Image sequences were recorded as functions of anatomical location or sub-glottal pressure. Implant materials were also imaged during vibration, both in isolation and after injection into a vocal fold.\nResults—Oscillations of epithelium and lamina propria were observed, and parameters such as shape, amplitude, and velocity of the vocal fold mucosal waves were found to be measurable. Ripples of mucosal wave as small as 100 μm in vertical height were clearly visible. Internal strain was also observed in normal and implanted vocal folds.\nConclusions—Four-dimensional OCT of the vocal fold may help to more directly relate biomechanics to anatomy and disease. It may also be useful for assaying the functional rheology of implants in the context of real tissue. With further development, this technology has potential for clinical endoscopic application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kobler","given":"James B."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Ernest W."},{"family":"Zeitels","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Yun","given":"Seok-Hyun"}],"citation-key":"Kobler2010Dynamic","container-title":"The Laryngoscope","container-title-short":"The Laryngoscope","DOI":"10.1002/lary.20938","ISSN":"0023852X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6,18]]},"language":"en","page":"1354-1362","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamic imaging of vocal fold oscillation with four-dimensional optical coherence tomography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.20938","volume":"120"},

  {"id":"Kohli2017Performance","abstract":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can generate high-resolution images of the esophagus that allows cross-sectional visualization of esophageal wall layers. We conducted a systematic review to assess the utility of OCT for diagnosing of esophageal intestinal metaplasia (IM; Barrett’s esophagus BE)), dysplasia, cancer and staging of early esophageal cancer. English language human observational studies and clinical trials published in PubMed and Embase were included if they assessed any of the following: (i) in-vivo features and accuracy of OCT at diagnosing esophageal IM, sub-squamous intestinal metaplasia (SSIM), dysplasia, or cancer, and (ii) accuracy of OCT in staging esophageal cancer. Twenty-one of the 2,068 retrieved citations met inclusion criteria. In the two prospective studies that assessed accuracy of OCT at identifying IM, sensitivity was 81%–97%, and specificity was 57%–92%. In the two prospective studies that assessed accuracy of OCT at identifying dysplasia and early cancer, sensitivity was 68%–83%, and specificity was 75%–82%. Observational studies described significant variability in the ability of OCT to accurately identify SSIM. Two prospective studies that compared the accuracy of OCT at staging early squamous cell carcinoma to histologic resection specimens reported accuracy of >90%. Risk of bias and applicability concerns was rated as low among the prospective studies using the QUADAS-2 questionnaire. OCT may identify intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, but its accuracy may not meet recommended thresholds to replace 4-quadrant biopsies in clinical practice. OCT may be more accurate than EUS at staging early esophageal cancer, but randomized trials and cost-effective analyses are lacking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kohli","given":"D.

  {"id":"Krajancich2019Handheld","abstract":"Handheld imaging probes are needed to extend the clinical translation of optical elastography to in vivo applications, yet such probes have received little attention. In this paper, we present the first demonstration of optical palpation using a handheld probe. Optical palpation is a variant of optical elastography that uses three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3D-OCT) to provide maps of stress at the tissue surface under static compression. Using this technique, stiff features present beneath the surface of turbid tissues are identified, providing mechanical contrast complementary to the optical contrast provided by OCT. However, during handheld operation, relative motion between the probe and the tissue can induce motion artifact, causing spatial distortion of 3D-OCT and in turn, optical palpation images. We overcome this issue using a novel, dual-function bi-layer that provides both a fiducial marker for co-registration and a compliant section for estimation of the stress at the tissue surface. Co-registration of digital photographs of the bi-layer laid out over the tissue surface is used to measure and correct for motion in the lateral (xy) plane. We also demonstrate, for the first time, that optical palpation can be used as a method for monitoring pressure applied to the tissue during handheld operation, thus providing a more repeatable and robust imaging technique between different users. Handheld optical palpation is demonstrated on a structured phantom, in vivo human skin and excised human breast tissue. In each case, image quality comparable to bench-top 3D-OCT and optical palpation is achieved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Krajancich","given":"Brooke"},{"family":"Curatolo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Zilkens","given":"Renate"},{"family":"Dessauvagie","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Christobel M."},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Brendan F."}],"citation-key":"Krajancich2019Handheld","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"Kravets2022Progressive","abstract":"Abstract\n            Compressive sensing (CS) is a sub-Nyquist sampling framework that has been employed to improve the performance of numerous imaging applications during the last 15 years. Yet, its application for large and high-resolution imaging remains challenging in terms of the computation and acquisition effort involved. Often, low-resolution imaging is sufficient for most of the considered tasks and only a fraction of cases demand high resolution, but the problem is that the user does not know in advance when high-resolution acquisition is required. To address this, we propose a multiscale progressive CS method for the high-resolution imaging. The progressive sampling refines the resolution of the image, while incorporating the already sampled low-resolution information, making the process highly efficient. Moreover, the multiscale property of the progressively sensed samples is capitalized for a fast, deep learning (DL) reconstruction, otherwise infeasible due to practical limitations of training on high-resolution images. The progressive CS and the multiscale reconstruction method are analyzed numerically and demonstrated experimentally with a single pixel camera imaging system. We demonstrate 4-megapixel size progressive compressive imaging with about half the overall number of samples, more than an order of magnitude faster reconstruction, and improved reconstruction quality compared to alternative conventional CS approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kravets","given":"Vladislav"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"Kravets2022Progressive","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-11401-7","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"language":"en","page":"7228","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Progressive compressive sensing of large images with multiscale deep learning reconstruction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11401-7","volume":"12"},

We monitor incision depth as it progresses, providing feedback to ensure that material removal occurs within a localized target volume, reducing the possibility of undesirable damage to tissues below the incision. Materials and Methods Ex vivo cortical and cancellous bone was ablated using pulsed lasers with center wavelengths of 1,064 and 1,070 nm, while being imaged in real-time using inline coherent imaging (ICI) at rates of up to 300 kHz and axial resolution of ∼6 µm. With real-time feedback, laser exposure was terminated before perforating into natural inclusions of the cancellous bone and verified by brightfield microscopy of the crater cross-sections accessed via side-polishing. Results ICI provides direct information about incision penetration even in the presence of intense backscatter from the pulsed laser and plasma emissions. In this study, ICI is able to anticipate structures 176 ± 8 µm below the ablation front with signal intensity 9 ± 2 dB above the noise floor. As a result, the operator is able to terminate exposure of the laser sparing a 50 µm thick layer of bone between the bottom of the incision to a natural inclusion in the cancellous bone. Versatility of the ICI system was demonstrated over a wide range of light–tissue interactions from thermal regime to direct solid-plasma transition. Conclusions ICI can be used as non-contact real-time feedback to monitor the depth of an incision created by laser ablation, especially in heterogeneous tissue where ablation rate is less predictable. Furthermore, ICI can image below the ablation front making it possible to stop laser exposure to limit unintentional damage to subsurface structures such as blood vessels or nervous tissue.

  {"id":"LeyuanFang2013Fast","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel technique, based on compressive sensing principles, for reconstruction and enhancement of multi-dimensional image data. Our method is a major improvement and generalization of the multi-scale sparsity based tomographic denoising (MSBTD) algorithm we recently introduced for reducing speckle noise. Our new technique exhibits several advantages over MSBTD, including its capability to simultaneously reduce noise and interpolate missing data. Unlike MSBTD, our new method does not require an a priori high-quality image from the target imaging subject and thus offers the potential to shorten clinical imaging sessions. This novel image restoration method, which we termed sparsity based simultaneous denoising and interpolation (SBSDI), utilizes sparse representation dictionaries constructed from previously collected datasets. We tested the SBSDI algorithm on retinal spectral domain optical coherence tomography images captured in the clinic. Experiments showed that the SBSDI algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,3]]},"author":[{"literal":"Leyuan Fang"},{"literal":"Shutao Li"},{"family":"McNabb","given":"Ryan P."},{"literal":"Qing Nie"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Anthony N."},{"family":"Toth","given":"Cynthia A."},{"family":"Izatt","given":"Joseph A."},{"family":"Farsiu","given":"Sina"}],"citation-key":"LeyuanFang2013Fast","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"Li2014Miniature","abstract":"Background and Objective: Investigations have shown that pulsed lasers tuned to 6.1 mm in wavelength are capable of ablating ocular and neural tissue with minimal collateral damage. This study investigated whether a miniature B-scan forward-imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe can be combined with the laser to provide real-time visual feedback during laser incisions. Study Design/Methods and Materials: A miniature 25gauge B-scan forward-imaging OCT probe was developed and combined with a 250 mm hollow-glass waveguide to permit delivery of 6.1 mm laser energy. A gelatin mixture and both porcine corneal and retinal tissues were simultaneously imaged and lased (6.1 mm, 10 Hz, 0.4–0.7 mJ) through air. The ablation studies were observed and recorded in real time. The crater dimensions were measured using OCT imaging software (Bioptigen, Durham, NC). Histological analysis was performed on the ocular tissues.\nResults: The combined miniature forward-imaging OCT and mid-infrared laser-delivery probe successfully imaged real-time tissue ablation in gelatin, corneal tissue, and retinal tissue. Application of a constant number of 60 pulses at 0.5 mJ/pulse to the gelatin resulted in a mean crater depth of 123 Æ 15 mm. For the corneal tissue, there was a signiﬁcant correlation between the number of pulses used and depth of the lased hole (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.82; P ¼ 0.0002). Histological analysis of the cornea and retina tissues showed discrete holes with minimal thermal damage.\nConclusions: A combined miniature OCT and laserdelivery probe can monitor real-time tissue laser ablation. With additional testing and improvements, this novel instrument has the future possibility of effectively guiding surgeries by simultaneously imaging and ablating tissue. Lasers Surg.

  {"id":"Li2017Forwardlooking","abstract":"Bronchoscopic diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer with ground-glass opacity (GGO) is dif cult because GGO lesions cannot be visualized using currently available radial probe endobronchial ultrasound. Therefore, a forward-looking single ber scanning optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe with a local observation function has been developed to achieve precise sampling. The new OCT probe is only 1 mm in diameter. The probe is composed of a patterned electroplated copper coil fabricated on a polyimide tube using non-planar photofabrication technique, and an optical ber having a permanent magnetic tube with a diameter of 0.5 mm. When an electrical alternating current is supplied to the coil, the permanent magnet vibrates electromagnetically with the optical ber. To increase the ber vibration amplitude, a micro gradient-index (GRIN) lens is set in front of the tip of the optical ber. Using the micro GRIN lens, the output beam is focused, and the scanning range is enlarged. The view angle becomes approximately 45 , and image resolution becomes approximately 60 μm. The structure of grating was successfully imaged using the new OCT probe.

However, a robust and accurate registration is still a challenge due to the modality-varied resolution, contrast, and luminosity. In this paper, a two step registration method is proposed to address this problem. Descriptor matching on mean phase images is used to globally register images in the ﬁrst step. Deformable registration based on modality independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) method is followed to locally reﬁne the registration result in the second step. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on color fundus images and scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) images. Both qualitative and quantitative tests demonstrate improved registration using the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art. The proposed method produces signiﬁcantly and substantially larger mean Dice coeﬃcients compared to other methods (p<0.001).

  {"id":"Li2019Advanced","abstract":"Endoscopic imaging is the main method for detecting gastrointestinal diseases, which adversely affect human health. White light endoscopy (WLE) was the first method used for endoscopic examination and is still the preliminary step in the detection of gastrointestinal diseases during clinical examination. However, it cannot accurately diagnose gastrointestinal diseases owing to its poor correlation with histopathological diagnosis. In recent years, many advanced endoscopic methods have emerged to improve the detection accuracy by endoscopy. Chromoendoscopy (CE) enhances the contrast between normal and diseased tissues using biocompatible dye agents. Narrow band imaging (NBI) can improve the contrast between capillaries and submucosal vessels by changing the light source acting on the tissue using special filters to realize the visualization of the vascular structure. Flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE) technique uses the reflectance spectrum estimation technique to obtain individual spectral images and reconstructs an enhanced image of the mucosal surface using three selected spectral images. The i-Scan technology takes advantage of the different reflective properties of normal and diseased tissues to obtain images, and enhances image contrast through post-processing algorithms. These abovementioned methods can be used to detect gastrointestinal diseases by observing the macroscopic structure of the digestive tract mucosa, but the ability of early cancer detection is limited with low resolution. However, based on the principle of confocal imaging, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) can enable cellular visualization with high-performance probes, which can present cellular morphology that is highly consistent with that shown by biopsy to provide the possibility of early detection of cancer. Other endoscopic imaging techniques including endoscopic optical coherence tomography (EOCT) and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE), are also promising for diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases. This review focuses on these technologies and aims to provide an overview of different technologies and their clinical applicability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Xiaohua"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Mengke"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Suya"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Longjie"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Ling"}],"citation-key":"Li2019Advanced","container-title":"Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery","container-title-short":"Quant.

However, it is not uncommon that OCTA imaging tend to suffer from strip artifacts induced by tissue motion. Although various algorithms for motion correction have been reported, a method that enables motion correction on a single en face OCTA image remains a challenge. In this study, we proposed a novel motion correction approach based on microvasculature detection and broken gap filling. Unlike previous methods using registration to restore disturbed vasculature during motion artifact removal, tensor voting is performed in individual projected image to connect the broken vasculature. Both simulation and in vivo 3D OCTA imaging of mouse bladder are performed to validate the effectiveness of this method. A comparison of in vivo images before and after motion correction shows that our method effectively corrects tissue motion artifacts while preserving continuity of vasculature network.

  {"id":"Li2019Multimodal","abstract":"While colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis and classification of colorectal cancer (CRC), its sensitivity and specificity are operator-dependent and are especially poor for small and flat lesions. Contemporary imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence, have been investigated to visualize microvasculature and morphological changes for detecting early stage CRC in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In our study, we developed a multimodal endoscopic system with simultaneous co-registered OCT and NIR fluorescence imaging. By introducing a contrast agent into the vascular network, NIR fluorescence is able to highlight the cancer-suspected area based on significant change of tumor vascular density and morphology caused by angiogenesis. With the addition of co-registered OCT images to reveal subsurface tissue layer architecture, the suspected regions can be further investigated by the altered light scattering resulting from the morphological abnormality. Using this multimodal imaging system, an in vivo animal study was performed using a F344-ApcPircUwm rat, in which the layered architecture and microvasculature of the colorectal wall at different time points were demonstrated. The co-registered OCT and NIR fluorescence images allowed the identification and differentiation of normal colon, hyperplastic polyp, adenomatous polyp, and adenocarcinoma. This multimodal imaging strategy using a single imaging probe has demonstrated the enhanced capability of identification and classification of CRC compared to using any of these technologies alone, thus has the potential to provide a new clinical tool to advance gastroenterology practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zhikai"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jason J."},{"family":"Jing","given":"Joseph C."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chung-Ho"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sehwan"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Phil-Sang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhongping"}],"citation-key":"Li2019Multimodal","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"Liang2019Optical","abstract":"Tethered capsule endomicroscopy (TCE) is an emerging screening technology that comprehensively obtains microstructural OCT images of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in unsedated patients. To advance clinical adoption of this imaging technique, it will be important to validate TCE images with co-localized histology, the current diagnostic gold standard. One method for co-localizing OCT images with histology is image-targeted laser marking, which has previously been implemented using a driveshaft-based, balloon OCT catheter, deployed during endoscopy. In this paper, we present a TCE device that scans and targets the imaging beam using a low-cost stepper motor that is integrated inside the capsule. In combination with a 4-laser-diode, high power 1430/1450 nm marking laser system (800 mW on the sample and 1s pulse duration), this technology generated clearly visible marks, with a spatial targeting accuracy of better than 0.5 mm. A laser safety study was done on swine esophagus ex vivo, showing that these exposure parameters did not alter the submucosa, with a large, 4-5x safety margin. The technology was demonstrated in living human subjects and shown to be effective for co-localizing OCT TCE images to biopsies obtained during subsequent endoscopy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Chia-Pin"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Ford","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Reddy","given":"Rohith"},{"family":"Hosseiny","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Farrokhi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Beatty","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Kanwarpal"},{"family":"Osman","given":"Hany"},{"family":"Vuong","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Grace"},{"family":"Grant","given":"Catriona"},{"family":"Giddings","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Gora","given":"Michalina J."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Nishioka","given":"Norman"},{"family":"Tearney","given":"Guillermo"}],"citation-key":"Liang2019Optical","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

However, the diagnosis and precise removal of tumors remain a challenge under the use of a white light laryngoscope. In this work, an integrated, multifunctional laryngoscope was designed and tested for the imaging evaluation and precision laser surgery for laryngeal tissue. This integrated diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic system included two imaging modes (i.e., optical coherence tomography and white light endoscopy) and a laser ablation treatment mode. The endoscope had a common-path design to ensure that the same position could be imaged and treated simultaneously.

  {"id":"Liang2020Tethered","abstract":"Objective  Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) screening outside the endoscopy suite can identify patients for surveillance and reduce mortality. Tethered capsule optical coherence tomography (OCT) can volumetrically image oesophageal mucosa in unsedated patients and detect features of BE. We investigated ultrahigh-s­ peed tethered capsule swept-s­ ource OCT (SS-O­ CT), improved device design, developed procedural techniques and measured capsule contact, longitudinal pullback non-u­ niformity and patient toleration. Design  OCT was performed in 16 patients prior to endoscopic surveillance/treatment. Unsedated patients swallowed the capsule with sips of water and the tether was pulled back to image the oesophagus. SS-­OCT at 1 000 000 A-­scans/s enabled imaging 10 cm oesophageal lengths in 10 s with 30 µm transverse and 8 µm axial resolution. Capsule contact, longitudinal image coverage and patient toleration were assessed.\nResults  Nine patients had non-­dysplastic BE, three had ablative treatment-­naïve neoplasia and four had prior ablation for dysplasia. Dry swallows facilitated capsule transit through the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES), and waiting 10 s before pullback reduced swallow induced LES relaxation. Slow nasal inhalation facilitated capsule retrieval and minimised gag reflex. The procedure was well tolerated. Ultrahigh-­speed SS-­OCT generated cross-­ sectional and subsurface en face images showing BE features, while subsurface en face images were required to assess the gastro-­oesophageal junction. Candidate features of dysplasia were also identified which could inform follow-­up endoscopy/biopsy. BE features were seen in all patients with histologically confirmed BE. Mean capsule contact over BE was 75%±27% for all patients and better in short segment BE. Mean longitudinal image coverage over BE was 59%±34% and better for long segment BE.\nConclusions  Ultrahigh-s­ peed tethered capsule SS-­OCT can image en face and cross-­sectional mucosal features over wide areas. Device and procedure optimisation improved performance. BE features could be identified in all patients, but limited capsule contact and longitudinal coverage could cause sampling errors for focal pathologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Kaicheng"},{"family":"Ahsen","given":"Osman O"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Annalee"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tan H"},{"family":"Potsaid","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Figueiredo","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Mashimo","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Fujimoto","given":"James G"}],"citation-key":"Liang2020Tethered","container-title":"BMJ Open Gastroenterology","container-title-short":"BMJ Open Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.1136/bmjgast-2020-000444","ISSN":"2054-4774","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"language":"en","page":"e000444","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tethered capsule en face optical coherence tomography for imaging Barrett’s oesophagus in unsedated patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmjopengastro.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjgast-2020-000444","volume":"7"},

The efficacy of this method was compared against a standard cross-correlation intensity-based registration method. With a fiducial marker adhered to the skin, OCT scans were acquired using two imaging protocols: direct imaging from air into tissue; and imaging through ultrasound gel into tissue, which minimized the refractive index mismatch at the tissue surface. The registration methods were assessed with data from both imaging protocols and showed reduced distortion of skin features due to motion. The fiducial-based method was found to be more accurate and robust, with an average RMS error below 20 µm and success rate above 90%. In contrast, the intensity-based method had an average RMS error ranging from 36 to 45 µm, and a success rate from 50% to 86%. The intensity-based algorithm was found to be particularly confounded by corrugations in the skin. By contrast, tissue features did not affect the fiducial-based method, as the motion correction was based on delineation of the flat fiducial marker. The average computation time for the fiducial-based algorithm was approximately 21 times less than for the intensity-based algorithm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liew","given":"Yih Miin"},{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Fiona M."},{"family":"Sampson","given":"David D."}],"citation-key":"Liew2012Motion","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

Despite great advances in instrumentation, the acquisition speed for a spectroscopic SRS image stack is fundamentally bounded by the pixel integration time. In this work, we report three-dimensional sparsely sampled spectroscopic SRS imaging that measures ~20% of pixels throughout the stack. In conjunction with related work in low-rank matrix completion (e.g., the Netflix Prize), we develop a regularized non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to decompose the sub-sampled image stack into spectral signatures and concentration maps. This design enables an acquisition speed of 0.8 s per image stack, with 50 frames in the spectral domain and 40,000 pixels in the spatial domain, which is faster than the conventional raster laser-scanning scheme by one order of magnitude. Such speed allows real-time metabolic imaging of living fungi suspended in a growth medium while effectively maintaining the spatial and spectral resolutions. This work is expected to promote broad application of matrix completion in spectroscopic laser-scanning imaging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Haonan"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Chien-Sheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Pu"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Ji-Xin"}],"citation-key":"Lin2017Spectroscopic","container-title":"Light: Science & Applications","container-title-short":"Light Sci Appl","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2017.179","ISSN":"2047-7538","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,25]]},"language":"en","page":"17179-17179","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spectroscopic stimulated Raman scattering imaging of highly dynamic specimens through matrix completion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2017179","volume":"7"},

The system utilizes a combination of standard fiber optic components and novel signal processing techniques in order to achieve high axial resolution and to simplify the system. High axial resolution is achieved by implementing the Enhanced Lee filter to reduce speckle noise in the OCT image and Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm afterwards to suppress sidelobes induced by the system’s point spread function.

  {"id":"Lodhi2017Computational","abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) has proven to be a viable method for reconstructing high-resolution signals using lowresolution measurements. Integrating CS principles into an optical system allows for higher-resolution imaging using lower-resolution sensor arrays. In contrast to prior works on CS-based imaging, our focus in this paper is on imaging through ﬁber-optic bundles, in which manufacturing constraints limit individual ﬁber spacing to around 2 µm. This limitation essentially renders ﬁber-optic bundles as low-resolution sensors with relatively few resolvable points per unit area. These ﬁber bundles are often used in minimally invasive medical instruments for viewing tissue at macro and microscopic levels. While the compact nature and ﬂexibility of ﬁber bundles allow for excellent tissue access in-vivo, imaging through ﬁber bundles does not provide the ﬁne details of tissue features that is demanded in some medical situations. Our hypothesis is that adapting existing CS principles to ﬁber bundle-based optical systems will overcome the resolution limitation inherent in ﬁber-bundle imaging. In a previous paper we examined the practical challenges involved in implementing a highly parallel version of the single-pixel camera while focusing on synthetic objects. This paper extends the same architecture for ﬁber-bundle imaging under incoherent illumination and addresses some practical issues associated with imaging physical objects. Additionally, we model the optical non-idealities in the system to get lower modelling errors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lodhi","given":"Muhammad A."},{"family":"Dumas","given":"John Paul"},{"family":"Pierce","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"Bajwa","given":"Waheed U."}],"citation-key":"Lodhi2017Computational","DOI":"10.1117/12.2263485","editor":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Fauzia"}],"event-place":"Anaheim, California, United States","event-title":"SPIE Commercial + Scientific Sensing and Imaging","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1021108","publisher-place":"Anaheim, California, United States","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Computational imaging through a fiber-optic bundle","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1117/12.2263485"},

  {"id":"Lowe2004Distinctive","abstract":"This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lowe","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"Lowe2004Distinctive","container-title":"International Journal of Computer Vision","container-title-short":"International Journal of Computer Vision","DOI":"10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94","ISSN":"0920-5691","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,11]]},"language":"en","page":"91-110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94","volume":"60"},

  {"id":"Ma2022Optical","abstract":"Cutting-edge biomedical ultrasound imaging demands advanced ultrasound sensing capabilities such as broad bandwidth, high sensitivity, and parallel sensing. A variety of optical ultrasound sensing modalities have demonstrated exceptional performances with advancing sensing capabilities. Compared with piezoelectric ul­ trasound transducers, optical ultrasound sensors exhibit more challenges in array integration. The broadband sensing capability originates from the absence of mechanical resonance in optical sensors, indicating a relatively uniform response across a wide frequency range. The sensitivity of sensors with optical resonance generally leads to higher sensitivity than the sensors without optical resonance due to enhanced parameters during the multibeam interference in resonance. Nevertheless, array integration of ultrasound sensors without optical reso­ nance is free of some constraints for those with resonance. This review paper introduces the principal parameters of biomedical ultrasound sensing, and then make an elaborate review of the state-of-the-art optical ultrasound sensing modalities, which hold significant potential for advanced biomedical ultrasound imaging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Jianguo"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xiangdong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Lijun"}],"citation-key":"Ma2022Optical","container-title":"Measurement","container-title-short":"Measurement","DOI":"10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111620","ISSN":"02632241","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"language":"en","page":"111620","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Optical ultrasound sensing for biomedical imaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0263224122008302","volume":"200"},

  {"id":"Macdonald2021Approximate","abstract":"Full-wave models of OCT image formation, which are based on Maxwell’s equations, are highly realistic. However, such models incur a high computational cost, particularly when modelling sample volumes consistent with those encountered in practice. Here, we present an approximate means of synthesizing volumetric image formation to reduce this computational burden. Instead of performing a full-wave scattered light calculation for each A-scan, we perform a full-wave scattered light calculation for a normally incident plane wave only. We use the angular spectrum field representation to implement beam focussing and scanning, making use of an assumption similar to the tilt optical memory effect, to approximately synthesize volumetric data sets. Our approach leads to an order of magnitude reduction in the computation time required to simulate typical B-scans. We evaluate this method by comparing rigorously and approximately evaluated point spread functions and images of highly scattering structured samples for a typical OCT system. Our approach also reveals new insights into image formation in OCT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Macdonald","given":"Callum M."},{"family":"Munro","given":"Peter R.

  {"id":"MacNeill2004Focal","abstract":"OBJECTIVES This study was designed to utilize optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of coronary atherosclerotic plaque macrophages to investigate the relationship between macrophage distributions and clinical syndrome.\nBACKGROUND The relative signiﬁcance of focal macrophage inﬁltration and generalized coronary inﬂammation for predicting acute coronary events is a currently a source of considerable controversy in cardiology. Lack of a high-resolution cross-sectional imaging modality has limited macrophage evaluation in vivo.\nMETHODS Intracoronary OCT imaging was performed at culprit and non-culprit plaques in patients presenting with stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Macrophage densities were quantiﬁed from these images and analyzed with respect to the clinical presentations of the patients under investigation.\nRESULTS A signiﬁcantly greater macrophage density was found in unstable patients, both for ﬁbrous and lipid-rich plaques (p ϭ 0.025 and p ϭ 0.002, respectively). Within each patient, the macrophage densities at culprit and non-culprit lesions correlated signiﬁcantly (r ϭ 0.66, y ϭ 0.88x ϩ 0.43, p ϭ 0.01). Sites of plaque rupture demonstrated a greater macrophage density than non-ruptured sites (6.95 Ϯ 1.60%, 5.29 Ϯ 1.17%; p ϭ 0.002). Surface macrophage inﬁltration was a stronger predictor of unstable clinical presentation than subsurface inﬁltration for culprit lesions (p ϭ 0.035) but not for remote lesions (p ϭ 0.80).\nCONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that increases in both multi-focal and focal macrophage densities are highly correlated with symptom severity. By providing a means of detecting increases in plaque macrophage content before an acute event, this technique may aid in determining prognosis and guiding preventive therapy.

However, videostroboscopy does not provide direct visualization of the superior-inferior movement of the vocal folds, which yields important clinical insight. In this paper, we present a novel technology that complements videostroboscopic ﬁndings by adding the ability to image the coronal plane and visualize the superior-inferior movement of the vocal folds. The technology is based on optical coherence tomography, which is combined with videostroboscopy within the same endoscopic probe to provide spatially and temporally co-registered images of the mucosal wave motion, as well as vocal folds subsurface morphology. We demonstrate the capability of the rigid endoscopic probe, in a benchtop setting, to characterize the complex movement and subsurface structure of the aerodynamically driven excised larynx models within the 50 to 200 Hz phonation range.

A double-clad ﬁber coupler is used to inject and collect OCT light into the core of a DCF and inject the therapy light into its larger inner cladding, allowing for both imaging and therapy to be perfectly coregistered. Monitoring of treatment depth is achieved by calculating the speckle intensity decorrelation occurring during tissue coagulation. Furthermore, an analytical noise correction was used on the correlation to extend the maximum monitoring depth. We also present a method for correcting motion-induced decorrelation using a lookup table. Using the value of the noise- and motion-corrected correlation coeﬃcient in a novel approach, our system is capable of identifying the depth of thermal coagulation in real time and automatically shut the therapy laser oﬀ when the targeted depth is reached.

High-dimensional states can often leverage a latent low-dimensional representation, and this inherent compressibility enables sparse sensing. This article explores optimized sensor placement for signal reconstruction based on a tailored library of features extracted from training data. Sparse point sensors are discovered using the singular value decomposition and QR pivoting, which are two ubiquitous matrix computations that underpin modern linear dimensionality reduction. Sparse sensing in a tailored basis is contrasted with compressed sensing, a universal signal recovery method in which an unknown signal is reconstructed via a sparse representation in a universal basis. Although compressed sensing can recover a wider class of signals, we demonstrate the beneﬁts of exploiting known patterns in data with optimized sensing. In particular, drastic reductions in the required number of sensors and improved reconstruction are observed in examples ranging from facial images to ﬂuid vorticity ﬁelds. Principled sensor placement may be critically enabling when sensors are costly and provides faster state estimation for low-latency, high-bandwidth control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Manohar","given":"Krithika"},{"family":"Brunton","given":"Bingni W."},{"family":"Kutz","given":"J.

Regular physical activity reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the risk of ACS or sudden cardiac death (SCD) increases during sport. In adults older than 35 years, exercise-related ACS or SCD is associated with plaque rupture, but not infrequently patients present ambiguous angiographic findings.\n              Methods\n              . Between September 2015 and January 2020, patients admitted for ACS or SCD triggered by physical exertion and with coronary stenosis ≤50% were included in this prospective observational study. OCT was performed on the artery deemed to be responsible of the event.\n              Results\n              . Ten patients were enrolled, predominantly men (80%) of middle age (51 years old, IQR 41–63) with low cardiovascular risk burden. Cycling was the most frequent (50%) exercise-related trigger, 8 patients were regular sport practitioners, and 7 had the clinical event during strenuous exertion. Five patients presented with non-ST-elevation ACS, two with ST-elevation ACS, and three with SCD. Angiographic analysis showed nonsignificant stenosis in all patients (42% stenosis, IQR 36–46). OCT identified the etiology of the event in 9 patients (4 plaque erosion, 3 plaque rupture, 1 eruptive calcific nodule, and 1 coronary dissection). Treatment was adjusted according to OCT findings.\n              Conclusions\n              .

  {"id":"Mavadia-Shukla2018Highspeed","abstract":"We present the first, most compact, ultrahigh-resolution, high-speed, distal scanning optical coherence tomography (OCT) endoscope operating at 800 nm. Achieving high speed imaging while maintaining an ultrahigh axial resolution is one of the most significant challenges with endoscopic OCT at 800 nm. Maintaining an ultrahigh axial resolution requires preservation of the broad spectral bandwidth of the light source throughout the OCT system. To overcome this critical limitation we implemented a distal scanning endoscope with diffractive optics to minimize loss in spectral throughput. In this paper, we employed a customized miniature 900 µm diameter DC micromotor fitted with a micro reflector to scan the imaging beam. We integrated a customized diffractive microlens into the imaging optics to reduce chromatic focal shift over the broad spectral bandwidth of the Ti:Sapphire laser of an approximately 150 nm 3dB bandwidth, affording a measured axial resolution of 2.4 µm (in air). The imaging capability of this high-speed, ultrahigh-resolution distal scanning endoscope was validated by performing 3D volumetric imaging of mouse colon in vivo at 50 frames-per-second (limited only by the A-scan rate of linear CCD array in the spectral-domain OCT system and sampling requirements). The results demonstrated that fine microstructures of colon could be clearly visualized, including the boundary between the absorptive cell layer and colonic mucosa as well the crypt patterns. Furthermore, this endoscope was employed to visualize morphological changes in an enterotoxigenic Bacteriodes fragilis (ETBF) induced colon tumor model. We present the results of our feasibility studies and suggest the potential of this system for visualizing time dependent morphological changes associated with tumorigenesis on murine models in vivo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mavadia-Shukla","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Fathi","given":"Payam"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Wenxuan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shaoguang"},{"family":"Sears","given":"Cynthia"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xingde"}],"citation-key":"Mavadia-Shukla2018Highspeed","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"Miri2016Multimodal","abstract":"With availability of diﬀerent retinal imaging modalities such as fundus photography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), having a robust and accurate registration scheme to enable utilization of this complementary information is beneﬁcial. The few existing fundus-OCT registration approaches contain a vessel segmentation step, as the retinal blood vessels are the most dominant structures that are in common between the pair of images. However, errors in the vessel segmentation from either modality may cause corresponding errors in the registration. In this paper, we propose a feature-based registration method for registering fundus photographs and SD-OCT projection images that beneﬁts from vasculature structural information without requiring blood vessel segmentation. In particular, after a preprocessing step, a set of control points (CPs) are identiﬁed by looking for the corners in the images. Next, each CP is represented by a feature vector which encodes the local structural information via computing the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) from the neighborhood of each CP. The best matching CPs are identiﬁed by calculating the distance of their corresponding feature vectors. After removing the incorrect matches the best aﬃne transform that registers fundus photographs to SD-OCT projection images is computed using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) method. The proposed method was tested on 44 pairs of fundus and SD-OCT projection images of glaucoma patients and the result showed that the proposed method successfully registers the multimodal images and produced a registration error of 25.34 ± 12.34 µm (0.84 ± 0.41 pixels).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Miri","given":"Mohammad Saleh"},{"family":"Abràmoff","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Young H."},{"family":"Garvin","given":"Mona K."}],"citation-key":"Miri2016Multimodal","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

The model employs vectorial focussing theory to represent the optical system and, thus, incorporates general illumination beam types and detection optics. To demonstrate its versatility, we model image formation of a stratiﬁed medium, a numerical point-spread function phantom and a numerical phantom, based upon a physical three-dimensional structured phantom employed in our laboratory.

Expert micro-surgeons are to manipulate fragile membranes or vessels while taking great care not to damage the underlying retina. Despite using high quality stereo microscopes, depth perception remains limited. Efforts have been conducted to enhance depth awareness through adding OCT or even force sensing. Whereas OCT has been predominantly used to assist in retinal membrane peeling procedures, so far little work has been conducted to use it for offering assistance during retinal vein cannulation. This abstract describes some ﬁrst results of a novel algorithm that has been designed to reliably estimate the distance to the retina from an instrument with integrated OCTﬁber. However, it is anticipated that the algorithm can be further expanded to estimate other useful characteristics as well. It could for example help to automatically detect vessels on the retina, or to estimate the diameter or center of a targeted vessel. Equipped with this knowledge more sophisticated assistive control schemes could be designed to further increase cannulation reliability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakata","given":"Ko"},{"family":"Ohji","given":"Masahito"},{"family":"Ikuno","given":"Yasushi"},{"family":"Kusaka","given":"Shunji"},{"family":"Gomi","given":"Fumi"},{"family":"Tano","given":"Yasuo"}],"citation-key":"Nakata2003Subretinal","container-title":"Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology","container-title-short":"Graefe's Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol","DOI":"10.1007/s00417-003-0676-y","ISSN":"0721-832X, 1435-702X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,7]]},"language":"en","page":"582-584","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sub-retinal hemorrhage during internal limiting membrane peeling for a macular hole","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00417-003-0676-y","volume":"241"},

Standard treatment for most of the tumors is radical surgery combined with stage-based neo-/adjuvant therapy. Laser surgery has become a reliable treatment option for oral cancer as well as for precancerous lesions. Widely used lasers in oral and maxillofacial tumor surgery are the CO2 laser, the Er:YAG laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the KTM laser. The use of lasers in tumor surgery has several advantages: remote application, precise cutting, hemostasis, low cicatrization, reduced postoperative pain and swelling, can be combined with endoscopic, microscopic and robotic surgery. However, laser surgery has some major drawbacks: In contrast to conventional incisions with scalpels, the surgeon gets no feedback during laser ablation. There is no depth sensation and no tissue specificity with a laser incision, increasing the risk of iatrogenic damage to nerves and major blood vessels. Future prospects may solve these problems by means of an optical feedback mechanism that provides a tissue-specific laser ablation. First attempts have been made to perform remote optical tissue differentiation. Additionally, real time optical tumor detection during laser surgery would allow for a very precise and straight forward cancer resection, enhancing organ preservation and hence the quality of life for patients with cancer in the head and neck region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Neukam","given":"F.W."},{"family":"Stelzle","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"Neukam2010Laser","container-title":"Physics Procedia","container-title-short":"Physics Procedia","DOI":"10.1016/j.phpro.2010.08.125","ISSN":"18753892","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"91-100","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Laser tumor treatment in oral and maxillofacial surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1875389210005511","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"Nishimura2017Cholesterol","abstract":"Background: Previous pathohistological studies demonstrated that cholesterol crystals (CCs) are frequently observed in atherosclerotic plaques, and are usually present abundantly in vulnerable plaques. However, the role of CCs in plaque destabilization, as well as their origin and composition, is unknown. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging system is a high-resolution imaging device, which allows the in vivo identiﬁcation of CCs accumulating within atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of CCs, other plaque morphologies assessed by OCT, and patients’ clinical characteristics including acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\nMethods and results: Preinterventional OCT images of 173 patients with either ACS or stable angina pectoris were studied. Of 173 lesions in the patients, 66 (38%) had CCs within the culprit lesion segment and 107 (62%) had non-CC lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, the presence of plaque rupture, intimal vasculature, and thrombus were independent factors associated with CCs. Moreover, the frequency of CCs increased in proportion to the accumulation of the number of components of their vulnerable plaque features within the culprit lesion segment. Compared with the plaques without thrombus, CCs were present at shallower locations in those with thrombus.\nConclusions: This study demonstrates the potential correlation between the clinical metabolic disorder and vulnerable morphological features of culprit lesions to the presence of CCs in patients with stable and unstable coronary syndromes. These observations of CCs by using in vivo plaque imaging could provide incremental value to OCT evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Nishimura","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Ehara","given":"Shoichi"},{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Takao"},{"family":"Matsumoto","given":"Kenji"},{"family":"Yoshikawa","given":"Junichi"},{"family":"Shimada","given":"Kenei"}],"citation-key":"Nishimura2017Cholesterol","container-title":"Journal of Cardiology","container-title-short":"Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jjcc.2016.04.003","ISSN":"09145087","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"language":"en","page":"253-259","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cholesterol crystal as a new feature of coronary vulnerable plaques: An optical coherence tomography study","title-short":"Cholesterol crystal as a new feature of coronary vulnerable plaques","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0914508716300491","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"Ossowski2018Realistic","abstract":"Realistic simulation of image formation in optical coherence tomography, based on Maxwell’s equations, has recently been demonstrated for sample volumes of practical signiﬁcance. Yet, there remains a limitation whereby reducing the size of cells used to construct a computational grid, thus allowing for more realistic representation of scatterer microstructure, necessarily reduces the overall sample size that can be modelled. This is a signiﬁcant problem since, as is well known, the microstructure of a scatterer signiﬁcantly inﬂuences its scattering properties. Here we demonstrate that optimized scatterer design can overcome this problem resulting in good agreement between simulated and experimental images for a structured phantom. This approach to OCT image simulation allows for image formation for biological tissues to be simulated with unprecedented realism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ossowski","given":"Paweł"},{"family":"Curatolo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Sampson","given":"David D."},{"family":"Munro","given":"Peter R.

  {"id":"Ourak2019Combined","abstract":"Purpose Retinal vein cannulation is an experimental procedure during which a clot-dissolving drug is injected into an obstructed retinal vein. However, due to the fragility and minute size of retinal veins, such procedure is considered too risky to perform manually. With the aid of surgical robots, key limiting factors such as: unwanted eye rotations, hand tremor and instrument immobilization can be tackled. However, local instrument anatomy distance and force estimation remain unresolved issues. A reliable, real-time local interaction estimation between instrument tip and the retina could be a solution. This paper reports on the development of a combined force and distance sensing cannulation needle, and its experimental validation during in vivo animal trials.\nMethods Two prototypes are reported, relying on force and distance measurements based on FBG and OCT A-scan ﬁbres, respectively. Both instruments provide an 80 µm needle tip and have outer shaft diameters of 0.6 and 2.3 mm, respectively.\nResults Both prototypes were characterized and experimentally validated ex vivo. Then, paired with a previously developed surgical robot, in vivo experimental validation was performed. The ﬁrst prototype successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a combined force and distance sensing instrument in an in vivo setting.\nConclusion The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying a combined sensing instrument in an in vivo setting. The performed study provides a foundation for further work on real-time local modelling of the surgical scene. This paper provides initial insights; however, additional processing remains necessary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ourak","given":"M."},{"family":"Smits","given":"J."},{"family":"Esteveny","given":"L."},{"family":"Borghesan","given":"G."},{"family":"Gijbels","given":"A."},{"family":"Schoevaerdts","given":"L."},{"family":"Douven","given":"Y."},{"family":"Scholtes","given":"J."},{"family":"Lankenau","given":"E."},{"family":"Eixmann","given":"T."},{"family":"Schulz-Hildebrandt","given":"H."},{"family":"Hüttmann","given":"G."},{"family":"Kozlovszky","given":"M."},{"family":"Kronreif","given":"G."},{"family":"Willekens","given":"K."},{"family":"Stalmans","given":"P."},{"family":"Faridpooya","given":"K."},{"family":"Cereda","given":"M."},{"family":"Giani","given":"A."},{"family":"Staurenghi","given":"G."},{"family":"Reynaerts","given":"D."},{"family":"Vander Poorten","given":"E.

The Lissajous fiber scanner was fully packaged as endomicroscopic catheter passing through the accessory channel of a clinical endoscope and combined with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

  {"id":"Pham2019Computational","abstract":"Objectives: There have been many advancements in laryngeal imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT), with varying system design and probes for use in research, office, and operating room settings. We evaluated the performance of six distinct OCT systems in imaging porcine vocal folds (cords) using computational image processing and segmentation.\nMethods: Porcine vocal folds were scanned using six OCT systems. Imaging system and probe performance were quantitatively assessed for signal penetration, layer differentiation, and epithelium (EP) measurement. Fitted exponential decay curves with corresponding α constant and intensity thresholding segmentation were utilized to quantify the aforementioned parameters.\nResults: The smallest average α constant and deepest signal penetration was of the SS-OCT 1700 nm 90 kHz microscope system (α= −1.74), followed by the SS-OCT 1310 nm 200 kHz VCSEL microscope system (α= −1.99), and SS-OCT 1310 nm 50 kHz rigid forward viewing endoscope system (α= −2.23). The EP was not readily visualized for three out of six systems, but was detected using automated segmentation. Average EP thickness (mean ± SD) was calculated as 55.79 ± 31.86 mm which agrees favorably with previous literature.\nConclusion: Comparisons of OCT systems are challenging, as they encompass different probe design, optical path, and lasers, depending on application. Practical evaluation of different systems using computer based quantitative image processing and segmentation revealed basic, constructive information, such as EP measurements. To further validate the comparisons of system performance with clinical usability, in vivo human laryngeal imaging will be conducted.

  {"id":"Phan2019Dense","abstract":"This paper introduces a structure from motion (SfM)-based surface reconstruction method for images including weak textures and structures. In SfM, the quality of the determination of homologous points between images plays a key role in terms of reconstruction performances. However, classical feature matching-based methods as integrated in the state-ofthe-art SfM-algorithms are often inoperative for images with weak structures and textures.

The perspectives and challenges that lie ahead are highlighted with a special focus on full spatial control at the nanoscale and high-throughput production scenarios. The rapid progress in the fabrication stage has opened new avenues toward the development of multifunctional plug and play platforms, discussed here with particular emphasis on new functionalities and unparalleled ﬁgures of merit, to demonstrate the potential of this powerful technology in many strategic application scenarios. The paper also analyses the beneﬁts obtained from merging lab-on-ﬁber (LOF) technology objectives with the emerging ﬁeld of optomechanics, especially at the microscale and the nanoscale. We illustrate the main advances at the fabrication level, describe the main achievements in terms of functionalities and performance, and highlight future directions and related milestones. All achievements reviewed and discussed clearly suggest that LOF technology is much more than a simple vision and could play a central role not only in scenarios related to diagnostics and monitoring but also in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ﬁeld, where optical ﬁbers have already yielded remarkable results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pisco","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Cusano","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"Pisco2020LabOnFiber","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s20174705","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"language":"en","page":"4705","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lab-On-Fiber Technology: A Roadmap toward Multifunctional Plug and Play Platforms","title-short":"Lab-On-Fiber Technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/17/4705","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"Pshenay-Severin2021Multimodal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Multimodal non-linear microscopy combining coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon excited fluorescence has proved to be a versatile and powerful tool enabling the label-free investigation of tissue structure, molecular composition, and correlation with function and disease status. For a routine medical application, the implementation of this approach into an in vivo imaging endoscope is required. However, this is a difficult task due to the requirements of a multicolour ultrashort laser delivery from a compact and robust laser source through a fiber with low losses and temporal synchronization, the efficient signal collection in epi-direction, the need for small-diameter but highly corrected endomicroobjectives of high numerical aperture and compact scanners. Here, we introduce an ultra-compact fiber-scanning endoscope platform for multimodal non-linear endomicroscopy in combination with a compact four-wave mixing based fiber laser. The heart of this fiber-scanning endoscope is an in-house custom-designed, single mode, double clad, double core pure silica fiber in combination with a 2.4 mm diameter NIR-dual-waveband corrected endomicroscopic objective of 0.55 numerical aperture and 180 µm field of view for non-linear imaging, allowing a background free, low-loss, high peak power laser delivery, and an efficient signal collection in backward direction. A linear diffractive optical grating overlays pump and Stokes laser foci across the full field of view, such that diffraction-limited performance is demonstrated for tissue imaging at one frame per second with sub-micron spatial resolution and at a high transmission of 65% from the laser to the specimen using a distal resonant fiber scanner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pshenay-Severin","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Bae","given":"Hyeonsoo"},{"family":"Reichwald","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Matz","given":"Gregor"},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Kobelke","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Lorenz","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Schwuchow","given":"Anka"},{"family":"Meyer-Zedler","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Messerschmidt","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Popp","given":"Juergen"}],"citation-key":"Pshenay-Severin2021Multimodal","container-title":"Light: Science & Applications","container-title-short":"Light Sci Appl","DOI":"10.1038/s41377-021-00648-w","ISSN":"2047-7538","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,5]]},"language":"en","page":"207","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multimodal nonlinear endomicroscopic imaging probe using a double-core double-clad fiber and focus-combining micro-optical concept","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-021-00648-w","volume":"10"},

In this work, we report a high-speed FMCW based 3D imaging system, combining a grating for beam steering with a compressed time-frequency analysis approach for depth retrieval. We thoroughly investigate the localization accuracy and precision of our system both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate 3D imaging results of multiple static and moving objects, including a flexing human hand.

Organized by topic, the book begins with the fundamental law of geometrical optics, Snell's law of refraction, and states the paraxial ray trace equations, then moves on to thin lenses and increasingly more sophisticated components and multi-element systems. Each topic is covered in depth and provides comprehensive information on performance and limitations. While the text is based on general optical laws, special emphasis has been placed on the two major infrared regions--the mid-wave (MWIR) and the long-wave (LWIR). This is particularly important with regard to diffractive hybrids, which have found their place in these long wavelength areas for the correction of chromatic aberrations and athermalization. Comments relating to single-point diamond turning have also been included because this process is predominantly used to produce optical elements for the infrared regions","author":[{"family":"Riedl","given":"Max J."}],"call-number":"QC372.2.D4 R54 2009","citation-key":"Riedl2009Optical","collection-number":"v.

This imaging system has a spatial depth resolution of 10 to 20 µm and a depth scanning range of 2.2 mm, obtaining images of 200 × 200 pixels at a maximum frame rate of 0.7 Hz. The scanning mechanism of the device is located at the distal end of a flexible probe that is placed in contact or near-contact with the area of interest. The tip of the probe was inserted through a rigid laryngoscope, and still images were obtained.\nResults—OCT images of arytenoids, aryepiglottic folds, piriform sinus, epiglottis, and true and false vocal cords were obtained. In patients whose OCT images were taken from normal tissue, the normal microstructures were clearly identified, as well as disruption of the latter in malignant pathologies.\nConclusions—The device can easily be incorporated into the operating room and requires minimal set-up and staff to operate.

  {"id":"Ryabkov2023Optical","abstract":"(1) Introduction. The problem that limits the intraoperative use of OCTA for the intestinal circulation diagnostics is the low informative value of OCTA images containing too many motion artifacts. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of the developed unit for the prevention of the appearance of motion artifacts in the OCTA images of the intestine in both open and laparoscopic surgery in the experiment; (2) Methods. A high-speed spectral-domain multimodal optical coherence tomograph (IAP RAS, Russia) operating at a wavelength of 1310 nm with a spectral width of 100 μm and a power of 2 mW was used. The developed unit was tested in two groups of experimental animals—on minipigs (group I, n = 10, open abdomen) and on rabbits (group II, n = 10, laparoscopy). Acute mesenteric ischemia was modeled and then 1 h later the small intestine underwent OCTA evaluation. A total of 400 OCTA images of the intact and ischemic small intestine were obtained and analyzed. The quality of the obtained OCTA images was evaluated based on the score proposed in 2020 by the group of Magnin M. (3) Results. Without stabilization, OCTA images of the intestine tissues were informative only in 32–44% of cases in open surgery and in 14–22% of cases in laparoscopic surgery. A vacuum bowel stabilizer with a pressure deficit of 22–25 mm Hg significantly reduced the number of motion artifacts. As a result, the proportion of informative OCTA images in open surgery increased up to 86.5% (Χ2 = 200.2, p = 0.001), and in laparoscopy up to 60% (Χ2 = 148.3, p = 0.001). (4) Conclusions. The used vacuum tissue stabilizer enabled a significant increase in the proportion of informative OCTA images by significantly reducing the motion artifacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryabkov","given":"Maksim"},{"family":"Sizov","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Bederina","given":"Evgeniya"},{"family":"Zarubenko","given":"Polina"},{"family":"Peretyagin","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Moiseev","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Vorobiev","given":"Aleksander"},{"family":"Gladkova","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Zaitsev","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Kiseleva","given":"Elena"}],"citation-key":"Ryabkov2023Optical","container-title":"Life","container-title-short":"Life","DOI":"10.3390/life13030705","ISSN":"2075-1729","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,6]]},"language":"en","page":"705","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography of the Intestine: How to Prevent Motion Artifacts in Open and Laparoscopic Surgery?","title-short":"Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography of the Intestine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/13/3/705","volume":"13"},

Hollow sapphire fibers were observed to exhibit a low attenuation region between 9.6-17.2 im and silica fibers between 7.25-9.5 im. This paper investigates the attenuation of sapphire and silica hollow waveguides from 6 - 20 m as a function of fiber diameter, launch conditions, and waveguide bend radius for cladding regions of both n>1 and n<1. The remote infrared chemical sensing capability of the hollow waveguides was demonstrated by detection of CO2 in N2 utilizing hollow sapphire fibers capped with ZnSe windows, and liquid benzene using sapphire fibers capped with diamond windows.

OCT’s greatest impact so far in the GI tract has been in the study of the tubular esophagus owing to its accessibility, less bends and folds and allowance of balloon employment with optimal contact to aid circumferential imaging. Moreover, given the alarming rise in the incidence of Barrett’s esophagus and its progression to adenocarcinoma in the U.S., OCT has helped identify pathological features that may guide future therapy and follow-up strategy.

  {"id":"Schmidbauer2009Fluorescence","abstract":"Background: The advantage of photodynamic diagnosis in detecting urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder has been demonstrated clearly, but it comes at the price of a higher falsepositive rate. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, real-time, microstructural imaging modality that uses near-infrared light for a point analysis of the bladder-wall microstructure.\nObjective: To evaluate whether adding targeted OCT analysis of lesions that are suspicious at white-light (WL) and hexaminolevulinate (HAL) ﬂuorescence cystoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy in the detection of UCC. Design, setting, and participants: In this prospective single-center study with same-patient comparison, patients with suspected UCC ﬁrst received an intravesical instillation of HAL. Cystoscopy was performed in WL, followed by blue-light inspection and OCT scanning. Intervention: Suspicious lesions identiﬁed by WL or HAL were evaluated by OCT and were subsequently resected or biopsied.\nMeasurements: We measured changes in sensitivity and speciﬁcity in detecting UCC using WL, HAL, and targeted OCT.\nResults and limitations: In 66 patients studied, 232 lesions were detected, were scanned by OCT, and were subsequently resected or biopsied. Additionally, 132 areas of normal-appearing urothelium were investigated by all three methods and biopsied. On a per-lesion basis, sensitivity and speciﬁcity were respectively 69.3% and 83.7% for WL, 97.5% and 78.6% for HAL, and 97.5% and 97.9% for HAL combined with OCT. Overall, UCC was diagnosed in 58 patients (87.9%), with a per-patient sensitivity of 89.7% for WL and 100% for both HAL alone and HAL with targeted OCT. Per-patient speciﬁcity for HAL alone and targeted HAL was 62.5% and 87.5%, respectively. The limitation of OCT results from poor visualization of ﬂat lesions in WL, making scanning a time-consuming procedure.\nConclusions: Combining ﬂuorescence cystoscopy with targeted OCT increases the speciﬁcity of ﬂuorescence cystoscopy signiﬁcantly, with no added morbidity, and reduces the need for unnecessary (false-positive) biopsies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidbauer","given":"Joerg"},{"family":"Remzi","given":"Mesut"},{"family":"Klatte","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Waldert","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Mauermann","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Susani","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Marberger","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"Schmidbauer2009Fluorescence","container-title":"European Urology","container-title-short":"European Urology","DOI":"10.1016/j.eururo.2009.07.042","ISSN":"03022838","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12]]},"language":"en","page":"914-919","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fluorescence Cystoscopy with High-Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging as an Adjunct Reduces False-Positive Findings in the Diagnosis of Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302283809007908","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"Schoeb2022Exvivo","abstract":"Background: The gold standard for detecting bladder cancer is white light cystoscopy (WLC) and resection of suspicious lesions. In this study, we evaluate two miniaturized Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) probes for endoscopic use, regarding their applicability in diagnosing urothelial cancer. Materials and methods: In total, 33 patients who underwent a radical cystectomy were included. Preoperative oncological staging and determining the indication for the surgical intervention were done following the latest European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines. Samples were taken from bladder tissue after bladder removal and prepared for OCT measurement. Additionally, porcine bladder samples were used as reference tissue. We took measurements using two miniaturized probes: a bimodal probe and a single modality OCT probe. A non-miniaturized standard OCT scanner was used as a reference.\nResults: Histopathological examination revealed urothelial cancer in all but three patients. Measurements on porcine tissue revealed a clear distinction between the urothelial layers for all probes. Furthermore, we detected improved image quality thanks to the stretching of the tissue. We took 271 measurements in human samples. While the urothelial layers were well delineated in healthy tissue, all the probes revealed a loss of these struc­ tures in cancerous regions.

  {"id":"Schwartz2013Energyguided","abstract":"High quality, large size volumetric imaging of biological tissue with optical coherence tomography (OCT) requires large number and high density of scans, which results in large data acquisition volume. This may lead to corruption of the data with motion artifacts related to natural motion of biological tissue, and could potentially cause conﬂicts with the maximum permissible exposure of biological tissue to optical radiation. Therefore, OCT can beneﬁt greatly from different approaches to sparse or compressive sampling of the data where the signal is recovered from its sub-Nyquist measurements. In this paper, a new energy-guided compressive sensing approach is proposed for improving the quality of images acquired with Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT) and reconstructed from sparse data sets. The proposed algorithm learns an optimized sampling probability density function based on the energy distribution of the training data set, which is then used for sparse sampling instead of the commonly used uniformly random sampling. It was demonstrated that the proposed energy-guided learning approach to compressive FD-OCT of retina images requires 45% fewer samples in comparison with the conventional uniform compressive sensing (CS) approach while achieving similar reconstruction performance. This novel approach to sparse sampling has the potential to signiﬁcantly reduce data acquisition while maintaining image quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Shimon"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chenyi"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Clausi","given":"David A."},{"family":"Fieguth","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Bizheva","given":"Kostadinka"}],"citation-key":"Schwartz2013Energyguided","container-title":"Optics Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

  {"id":"Seibel2006Fullcolor","abstract":"Minimally invasive medical procedures will benefit from flexible endoscopes that are extremely thin yet produce high quality images. Current devices use fiber bundles or silicon image sensors placed in the distal tip where each pixel in the image is derived from an element in the distal tip, such that improving resolution requires increasing distal tip diameter. The University of Washington has developed the scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) to provide full color, high resolution images from a flexible endoscope with a small distal tip diameter. The SFE uses a single mode fiber vibrating in resonance to scan a focused laser spot over the tissue and a detector to record the time-multiplexed backscatter signal. The SFE contains a 400 micron diameter piezoelectric tube through which a length of singlemode optical fiber is placed. The tube drives the fiber tip at its resonant frequency (currently 5 KHz) in an expanding pattern of 250 spirals (500 pixel diameter image) at a frame rate of 15 Hertz. Imaging parameters are determined by the lens system placed in the 1.06 mm diameter distal tip. Prototype systems with 70 degree field-of-view and 10 micron resolution have been developed. Color images are created with red, green, and blue laser sources coupled into the single scanning fiber. Backscattered light is collected with twelve 250 micron multimode fibers placed around the periphery of the microscanner resulting in a total distal tip diameter of 1.6 mm. Frame sequential color, fluorescence, and continuous color imaging modes have been demonstrated in the non-confocal geometry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Seibel","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Melville","given":"C.

  {"id":"Seibel20081mm","abstract":"Flexible endoscopes use one sensor element per display pixel. When diameter is reduced to the size of a catheter, there is a significant reduction in the number of pixels within the image. By placing a sub-millimeter microscanner at the tip of a catheter, image quality can be significantly improved. The microscanner consists of a 0.4 mm diameter piezoelectric tube with quadrant electrodes, surrounding a cantilevered singlemode optical fiber. At the distal end, the fiber microscanner is sealed with a 0.9 mm diameter lens assembly, creating a rigid length less than 10 mm at the tip of a highly flexible shaft. The cantilevered fiber is vibrated at the first mode of resonance for bending to generate a circular scan pattern. A spiral scan pattern is generated that constitutes an image frame by modulating the piezoelectric drive signals. By using a custom optical fiber at 80 microns cladding diameter, >10 KHz resonant scanning is achieved, resulting in a 30 Hz frame rate. Red (635 nm), green (532 nm), and blue (442 nm) laser light is scanned by coupling to the fiber scanner. The scanned illumination is detected in a non-confocal arrangement by having one or more optical fibers collecting the backscattered light at MHz pixel rates. Current 1-mm diameter catheterscopes generate 500-line images at maximum fields of view of 100 degrees and spatial resolutions of <20 microns with image zooming.

Key inclusion criteria were a 99% to 100% stenosed femoropopliteal segment, lesion length between 1 and 30 cm, and resistance to guidewire crossing. The main exclusion criterion was a severely calcified target vessel. The primary safety endpoint was 30-day major adverse events (MAE), while the primary effectiveness endpoint was successful CTO crossing (i.e., guidewire placement in the distal true lumen) with the Ocelot catheter. Endpoint analysis was based on pre-specified objective performance criteria. Between February and June 2012, 100 patients (55 men; mean age 69 years) were enrolled. Most of the CTOs (94%) were in the superficial femoral artery (SFA); mean lesion length was 16.669.3 cm.\nResults: Through 30 days, 2 patients experienced MAE (significant perforations) related to the Ocelot catheter. The Ocelot catheter successfully crossed 97% of target CTOs either alone (72%), in conjunction with an assist device (18%), or in conjunction with a re-entry device (7%).

By bringing together all aspects of microsystem design, it can be expected to facilitate the training of not only a new generation of engineers, but perhaps a whole new type of engineer – one capable of addressing the complex range of problems involved in reducing entire systems to the micro- and nano-domains. This book breaks down disciplinary barriers to set the stage for systems we do not even dream of today. Microsystems have a long history, dating back to the earliest days of mic- electronics. While integrated circuits developed in the early 1960s, a number of laboratories worked to use the same technology base to form integrated sensors. The idea was to reduce cost and perhaps put the sensors and circuits together on the same chip. By the late-60s, integrated MOS-photodiode arrays had been developed for visible imaging, and silicon etching was being used to create thin diaphragms that could convert pressure into an electrical signal. By 1970, selective anisotropic etching was being used for diaphragm formation, retaining a thick silicon rim to absorb package-induced stresses. Impurity- and electrochemically-based etch-stops soon emerged, and \"bulk micromachining\" came into its own.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Senturia","given":"Stephen D"}],"citation-key":"Senturia2001Microsystem","ISBN":"978-0-306-47601-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1050943329","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Microsystem Design","type":"book","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/b117574"},

Tracing and extracting contour pixels are widely used for smart/wearable image sensor devices, because these are simple and useful for detecting objects. In this paper, we present a novel contour-tracing algorithm for fast and accurate contour following. The proposed algorithm classiﬁes the type of contour pixel, based on its local pattern. Then, it traces the next contour using the previous pixel’s type. Therefore, it can classify the type of contour pixels as a straight line, inner corner, outer corner and inner-outer corner, and it can extract pixels of a speciﬁc contour type. Moreover, it can trace contour pixels rapidly because it can determine the local minimal path using the contour case. In addition, the proposed algorithm is capable of the compressing data of contour pixels using the representative points and inner-outer corner points, and it can accurately restore the contour image from the data. To compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to that of conventional techniques, we measure their processing time and accuracy. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance compared to the others. Furthermore, it can provide the compressed data of contour pixels and restore them accurately, including the inner-outer corner, which cannot be restored using conventional algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Seo","given":"Jonghoon"},{"family":"Chae","given":"Seungho"},{"family":"Shim","given":"Jinwook"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dongchul"},{"family":"Cheong","given":"Cheolho"},{"family":"Han","given":"Tack-Don"}],"citation-key":"Seo2016Fast","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s16030353","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,9]]},"language":"en","page":"353","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fast Contour-Tracing Algorithm Based on a Pixel-Following Method for Image Sensors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/3/353","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Sevilla-Lara2012Distribution","abstract":"Visual tracking of general objects often relies on the assumption that gradient descent of the alignment function will reach the global optimum. A common technique to smooth the objective function is to blur the image. However, blurring the image destroys image information, which can cause the target to be lost. To address this problem we introduce a method for building an image descriptor using distribution ﬁelds (DFs), a representation that allows smoothing the objective function without destroying information about pixel values. We present experimental evidence on the superiority of the width of the basin of attraction around the global optimum of DFs over other descriptors. DFs also allow the representation of uncertainty about the tracked object. This helps in disregarding outliers during tracking (like occlusions or small misalignments) without modeling them explicitly. Finally, this provides a convenient way to aggregate the observations of the object through time and maintain an updated model. We present a simple tracking algorithm that uses DFs and obtains state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sevilla-Lara","given":"L."},{"family":"Learned-Miller","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"Sevilla-Lara2012Distribution","container-title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247891","event-place":"Providence, RI","event-title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","ISBN":"978-1-4673-1228-8 978-1-4673-1226-4 978-1-4673-1227-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1910-1917","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Providence, RI","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Distribution fields for tracking","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6247891/"},

Study Design/Materials and Methods: We studied 26 patients with laryngeal carcinoma in situ and in T1, T2 stage. We used an endoscopic OCT device for imaging at a wavelength of 0.83 mm with the acquisition rate of approximately 0.5 frames/s for a single (200 Â 200 pixel) tomogram. All patients were operated with a surgical YAG:Nd laser at two switchable wavelengths of 1.44 mm and 1.32 mm by laryngo®ssure, direct microlaryngoscopy, and ®brolaryngoscopy.\nResults: Information on structural alterations in laryngeal mucosa to the depth of 2 mm, obtained by OCT, makes it possible to precisely locate tumor borders, thus giving an opportunity to control the surgical treatment of laryngeal carcinoma. The YAG:Nd laser scalpel with wavelengths of 1.32 mm and 1.44 mm is successful in surgical procedures both in open and closed larynx due to ef®cient coagulation and minimization of collateral tissue damage area. Combination of the two wavelengths in the single laser unit and intraoperative OCT monitoring result is a new modality for minimally invasive larynx surgery.\nConclusions: OCT is promising to become a new diagnosing method of laryngeal carcinoma and a tool for laser treatment monitoring.

Such minimally invasive imagers allow for navigation into hard-to-reach regions and observation of deep brain activity in freely moving animals. Conventional solutions use distal microlenses. However, as lenses become smaller and less invasive, they develop greater aberrations and restricted fields of view. In addition, most of the imagers capable of variable focusing require mechanical actuation of the lens, increasing the distal complexity and weight. Here, we demonstrate a distal lens-free approach to microendoscopy enabled by computational image recovery. Our approach is entirely actuation free and uses a single pseudorandom spatial mask at the distal end of a multicore fiber. Experimentally, this lensless approach increases the space-bandwidth product, i.e., field of view divided by resolution, by threefold over a best-case lens-based system. In addition, the microendoscope demonstrates color resolved imaging and refocusing to 11 distinct depth planes from a single camera frame without any actuated parts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Shin","given":"Jaewook"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Dung N."},{"family":"Stroud","given":"Jasper R."},{"family":"Chin","given":"Sang"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Trac D."},{"family":"Foster","given":"Mark A."}],"citation-key":"Shin2019Minimally","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Sci.

The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4% and 2.3% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

Most of the existing literature focuses on miniaturizing the optical detection; little attention is directed to on-chip optical excitation. In this work, we design a metasurface to create a planar integrated photonic source beam collimator for use in on-chip optofluidic sensing applications. We use an iterative inverse design approach in order to optimize the metasurface to achieve a target performance using gradient descent method. We then fabricate beam collimators and experimentally compare performance characteristics with conventional uniform binary grating-based photonic beam diffractors. The optimal design enhances the illumination power by a factor of 5. The reinforced beam is more uniform with 3 dB beam spot increased almost ~ 3 times for the same device footprint area.

We also show that further improvement of the estimated attenuation coefﬁcient is possible by formulating image denoising as a convex optimization problem that we term Intensity Weighted Horizontal Total Variation (iwhTV). The performance and accuracy of DRC alone and DRC+iwhTV are validated with simulated data, optical phantoms, and ex-vivo porcine tissue.

  {"id":"Smith2019Volumetric","abstract":"SUMMARY\n            Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) for real-time, microscopic cross-sectional imaging. A US-based multi-center registry was constructed to prospectively collect data on patients undergoing upper endoscopy during which a VLE scan was performed. The objective of this registry was to determine usage patterns of VLE in clinical practice and to estimate quantitative and qualitative performance metrics as they are applied to Barrett's esophagus (BE) management. All procedures utilized the NvisionVLE Imaging System (NinePoint Medical, Bedford, MA) which was used by investigators to identify the tissue types present, along with focal areas of concern. Following the VLE procedure, investigators were asked to answer six key questions regarding how VLE impacted each case. Statistical analyses including neoplasia diagnostic yield improvement using VLE was performed. One thousand patients were enrolled across 18 US trial sites from August 2014 through April 2016. In patients with previously diagnosed or suspected BE (894/1000), investigators used VLE and identified areas of concern not seen on white light endoscopy (WLE) in 59% of the procedures. VLE imaging also guided tissue acquisition and treatment in 71% and 54% of procedures, respectively. VLE as an adjunct modality improved the neoplasia diagnostic yield by 55% beyond the standard of care practice. In patients with no prior history of therapy, and without visual findings from other technologies, VLE-guided tissue acquisition increased neoplasia detection over random biopsies by 700%. Registry investigators reported that VLE improved the BE management process when used as an adjunct tissue acquisition and treatment guidance tool. The ability of VLE to image large segments of the esophagus with microscopic cross-sectional detail may provide additional benefits including higher yield biopsies and more efficient tissue acquisition.

  {"id":"Stolker2012Repeat","abstract":"Background—Although drug-eluting stents and intensive secondary prevention have contributed to improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), repeat revascularization remains relatively common in contemporary practice. We used data from the multicenter Evaluation of Drug-Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events registry to evaluate the relative frequency and timing of staged revascularization, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and other nontarget revascularization during the first year after contemporary PCI.\nMethods and Results—Patients with staged revascularization, TLR, and other unplanned procedures (elsewhere in the target vessel or in other coronary arteries) were evaluated in time-dependent models using Kaplan-Meier life-table estimation. Predictors of TLR and unplanned revascularization at nontarget sites were identified using logistic regression. Between July 2004 to June 2007, 10 144 patients undergoing PCI were enrolled at 55 US hospitals, of whom 86% were treated with at least 1 drug-eluting stent. Twelve percent required repeat revascularization within the first year (3% staged; 9% unplanned). More than 75% of staged revascularizations were performed <30 days after index PCI, although there was significant variation in this practice across hospitals (range, 0%–54%). TLR occurred in 4.5% of patients, with higher hazard rates between 2 to 9 months after PCI, whereas the risk of unplanned non-TLR (4.4% cumulative incidence) was constant over time.\nConclusions—Among unselected patients undergoing PCI in the drug-eluting stent era, the incidence of repeat revascularization at 1 year is ≈12%. Among unplanned procedures, only half are performed for TLR. To achieve further improvements in PCI outcomes, future efforts should concentrate as much on identifying ischemia-producing lesions and intensifying secondary prevention therapies as on the prevention of restenosis.  (Circ Cardiovasc Interv. 2012;5:772-782.)","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Stolker","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"David J."},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Kevin F."},{"family":"Pencina","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Lindsey","given":"Jason B."},{"family":"Mauri","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Cutlip","given":"Donald E."},{"family":"Kleiman","given":"Neal S."}],"citation-key":"Stolker2012Repeat","container-title":"Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions","container-title-short":"Circ Cardiovasc Interv","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.111.967802","ISSN":"1941-7640, 1941-7632","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12]]},"language":"en","page":"772-782","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Repeat Revascularization After Contemporary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: An Evaluation of Staged, Target Lesion, and Other Unplanned Revascularization Procedures During the First Year","title-short":"Repeat Revascularization After Contemporary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.111.967802","volume":"5"},

The detection of tumour infiltrated regions so far requires histological analysis of biopsies taken from at expected tumour boundaries. The gold standard for histological analysis is the staining of thin cut specimen and the evaluation by a neuropathologist. This work presents a way to transfer the histological evaluation of a neuropathologist onto optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. OCT is a method suitable for real time\n              in vivo\n              imaging during neurosurgery however the images require processing for the tumour detection. The method demonstrated here enables the creation of a dataset which will be used for supervised learning in order to provide a better visualization of tumour infiltrated areas for the neurosurgeon. The created dataset contains labelled OCT images from two different OCT-systems (wavelength of 930 nm and 1300 nm). OCT images corresponding to the stained histological images were determined by shaping the sample, a controlled cutting process and a rigid transformation process between the OCT volumes based on their topological information. The histological labels were transferred onto the corresponding OCT images through a non-rigid transformation based on shape context features retrieved from the sample outline in the histological image and the OCT image. The accuracy of the registration was determined to be 200 ± 120\n              μ\n              m. The resulting dataset consists of 1248 labelled OCT images for each of the two OCT systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Strenge","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Birgit"},{"family":"Grill","given":"Christin"},{"family":"Draxinger","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Danicke","given":"Veit"},{"family":"Theisen-Kunde","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Hagel","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Spahr-Hess","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Bonsanto","given":"Matteo M"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Handels","given":"Heinz"},{"family":"Brinkmann","given":"Ralf"}],"citation-key":"Strenge2022Registration","container-title":"Physics in Medicine & Biology","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"Stroud2019Optical","abstract":"The three-dimensional volumetric imaging capability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) leads to the generation of large amounts of data, which necessitates high speed acquisition followed by high dimensional image processing and visualization. This signal acquisition and processing pipeline demands high A-scan rates on the front end, which has driven researchers to push A-scan acquisition rates into the MHz regime. To this end, the optical time-stretch approach uses a mode locked laser (MLL) source, dispersion in optical ﬁber, and a single analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to achieve multi-MHz A-scan rates. While enabling impressive performance this Nyquist sampling approach is ultimately constrained by the sampling rate and bandwidth of the ADC. Additionally such an approach generates massive amounts of data. Here we present a compressed sensing (CS) OCT system that uses a MLL, electro-optic modulation, and optical dispersion to implement data compression in the physical domain and rapidly acquire real-time compressed measurements of the OCT signals. Compression in the analog domain prior to digitization allows for the use of lower bandwidth ADCs, which reduces cost and decreases the required data capacity of the sampling interface. By leveraging a compressive A-scan optical sampling approach and the joint sparsity of C-scan data we demonstrate 14.4-MHz to 144-MHz A-scan acquisition speeds using a sub-Nyquist 1.44 Gsample/sec ADC sampling rate. Furthermore we evaluate the impact of data compression and resulting imaging speed on image quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Stroud","given":"Jasper R."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Luoluo"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Sang"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Trac D."},{"family":"Foster","given":"Mark A."}],"citation-key":"Stroud2019Optical","container-title":"Optics Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

  {"id":"Su2010Advances","abstract":"Importance of the field: Photoacoustic imaging is an imaging modality that derives image contrast from the optical absorption coefficient of the tissue being imaged. The imaging technique is able to differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue with either deeper penetration or higher resolution than other functional imaging modalities available at present. From a clinical standpoint, photoacoustic imaging has demonstrated safety and effectiveness in diagnosing diseased tissue regions using either endogenous tissue contrast or exogenous contrast agents. Furthermore, the potential of photoacoustic imaging has been demonstrated in various therapeutic interventions, ranging from drug delivery and release to image-guided therapy and monitoring. Areas covered in this review: This article reviews the current state of photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine from a technological perspective, highlights various biomedical and clinical applications of photoacoustic imaging, and gives insights on future directions. What the reader will gain: Readers will learn about the various applications of photoacoustic imaging, as well as the various contrast agents that can be used to assist photoacoustic imaging. This review highlights both preclinical and clinical uses for photoacoustic imaging, as well as discussing some of the challenges that must be addressed to move photoacoustic imaging into the clinical realm. Take home message: Photoacoustic imaging offers unique advantages over existing imaging modalities. The imaging field is broad with many exciting applications for detecting and diagnosing diseased tissue or processes. Photoacoustics is also used in therapeutic applications to identify and characterize the pathology and then to monitor the treatment. Although the technology is still in its infancy, much work has been done in the preclinical arena, and photoacoustic imaging is fast approaching the clinical setting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Su","given":"Jimmy L"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Katheryne E"},{"family":"Bayer","given":"Carolyn L"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yun-Sheng"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seungsoo"},{"family":"Homan","given":"Kimberly A"},{"family":"Emelianov","given":"Stanislav Y"}],"citation-key":"Su2010Advances","container-title":"Expert Opinion on Medical Diagnostics","container-title-short":"Expert Opinion on Medical Diagnostics","DOI":"10.1517/17530059.2010.529127","ISSN":"1753-0059, 1753-0067","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,11]]},"language":"en","page":"497-510","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Advances in clinical and biomedical applications of photoacoustic imaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/17530059.2010.529127","volume":"4"},

The scanning motion of the assembled scanner utilizing the fabricated 3D coil, fiber and a small magnet has been measured by a high-speed camera. The scanner consists of a 9 mm-length optical fiber, a 2 mm outer diameter cylindrical magnet, a jig and a fabricated tilted coil. The displacement of the fiber tip in the scanner is observed and measured when the alternative current-driven voltage was applied to the tilted coil, and 126.8 µm maximum displacement has been obtained.

  {"id":"SwagerDETECTION","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and clinical relevance of Buried Barrett’s (BB) epithelium after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is questioned. Recent studies using small optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheters for scanning underneath the neosquamous epithelium demonstrated a high prevalence of tissue structures that might correspond to BB. Histological correlation, however, is lacking. Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) is a novel balloon-based OCT imaging technique that provides a 6-cm long circumferential volumetric scan of the esophageal wall layers to a depth of 3 mm with a resolution comparable to low-power microscopy. AIM: To evaluate if post-RFA subsquamous structures, detected with VLE, actually correspond to BB and to pursue direct histological correlation of VLE images.\nMETHODS: In-vivo VLE was performed to detect subsquamous structures suspicious for BB in patients with 100% endoscopic regression of dysplastic Barrett’s epithelium after RFA. Areas with suspicious subsquamous VLE structures were marked with electrocoagulation after which in-vivo VLE was repeated to confirm that the correct area was demarcated. These areas were subsequently resected endoscopically, followed by immediate ex-vivo VLE scanning to reconfirm the presence of the subsquamous VLE structures. Extensive histological sectioning was then performed and all histopathology slides were evaluated by an expert BE pathologist (blinded for VLE images).\nRESULTS: In 9 patients, 6 areas with suspicious subsquamous structures were seen on in-vivo VLE and resected. Ex-vivo VLE of these 6 ER specimens reconfirmed the presence of these subsquamous structures in 5 ER specimens. Extensive histological sectioning of these areas showed BB in one area. The other subsquamous VLE structures corresponded to dilated (ducts of) (sub)mucosal glands or blood vessels.\nCONCLUSION: VLE may potentially detect BB under endoscopically normal appearing neosquamous epithelium. However, most post-RFA subsquamous structures identified by in-vivo VLE did not correspond to BB. Further studies are required to identify VLE features that allow for differentiation of BB from normal subsquamous structures.","author":[{"family":"Swager","given":"A"},{"family":"Boerwinkel","given":"DF"},{"family":"Bruin","given":"DM","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Faber","given":"DJ"},{"family":"Leeuwen","given":"AG","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Weusten","given":"BL"},{"family":"Meijer","given":"SL"},{"family":"Bergman","given":"JJ"},{"family":"Curvers","given":"WL"}],"citation-key":"SwagerDETECTION","language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"DETECTION OF BURIED BARRETT’S GLANDS AFTER RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION WITH VOLUMETRIC LASER ENDOMICROSCOPY; A HISTOLOGY CORRELATION PILOT STUDY","type":"article-journal"},

Calibration of the robot-OCT and robot-needle transforms, wound detection, keypoint identification, and path planning are all performed automatically. The calibration method handles pose uncertainty when the needle is grasped using a variant of iterative closest points. The path planner uses the identified wound shape to calculate needle entry and exit points to yield an evenly-matched wound shape after closure.

First, a local illumination change model is proposed and used to mathematically check whether a descriptor is invariant or not with respect to illumination variations between images. Then, this contribution proposes two general mathematical formulations which can be used to design a wide variety of new illumination-invariant descriptors. To illustrate the interest of the proposed approach, two novel illumination-invariant descriptors are constructed using the proposed general formulations. Moreover, the performance of the descriptors was evaluated on numerous datasets with known ground truth optical flow, while the robustness of the variational optical flow approach was highlighted using complex medical image sequences without ground truth.

In this work, we close this performance gap by introducing a neural nano-optics imager. We devise a fully differentiable learning framework that learns a metasurface physical structure in conjunction with a neural feature-based image reconstruction algorithm. Experimentally validating the proposed method, we achieve an order of magnitude lower reconstruction error than existing approaches.

  {"id":"Ughi2016Automated","abstract":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical diagnostic modality that can acquire cross-sectional images of the microscopic structure of the esophagus, including Barrett’s esophagus (BE) and associated dysplasia. We developed a swallowable tethered capsule OCT endomicroscopy (TCE) device that acquires high-resolution images of entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract luminal organs. This device has a potential to become a screening method that identifies patients with an abnormal esophagus that should be further referred for upper endoscopy. Currently, the characterization of the OCT-TCE esophageal wall data set is performed manually, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, since the capsule optics optimally focus light approximately 500 µm outside the capsule wall and the best quality images are obtained when the tissue is in full contact with the capsule, it is crucial to provide feedback for the operator about tissue contact during the imaging procedure. In this study, we developed a fully automated algorithm for the segmentation of in vivo OCT-TCE data sets and characterization of the esophageal wall. The algorithm provides a two-dimensional representation of both the contact map from the data collected in human clinical studies as well as a tissue map depicting areas of BE with or without dysplasia. Results suggest that these techniques can potentially improve the current TCE data acquisition procedure and provide an efficient characterization of the diseased esophageal wall.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Ughi","given":"Giovanni J."},{"family":"Gora","given":"Michalina J."},{"family":"Swager","given":"Anne-Fré"},{"family":"Soomro","given":"Amna"},{"family":"Grant","given":"Catriona"},{"family":"Tiernan","given":"Aubrey"},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Sauk","given":"Jenny S."},{"family":"Nishioka","given":"Norman S."},{"family":"Tearney","given":"Guillermo J."}],"citation-key":"Ughi2016Automated","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"Ughi2016Clinical","abstract":"OBJECTIVES We present the clinical imaging of human coronary arteries in vivo using a multimodality optical coherence tomography (OCT) and near-infrared autoﬂuorescence (NIRAF) intravascular imaging system and catheter.\nBACKGROUND Although intravascular OCT is capable of providing microstructural images of coronary atherosclerotic lesions, it is limited in its capability to ascertain the compositional/molecular features of plaque. A recent study in cadaver coronary plaque showed that endogenous NIRAF is elevated in necrotic core lesions. The combination of these 2 technologies in 1 device may therefore provide synergistic data to aid in the diagnosis of coronary pathology in vivo.\nMETHODS We developed a dual-modality intravascular imaging system and 2.6-F catheter that can simultaneously acquire OCT and NIRAF data from the same location on the artery wall. This technology was used to obtain volumetric OCT-NIRAF images from 12 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Images were acquired during a brief, nonocclusive 3- to 4-ml/s contrast purge at a speed of 100 frames/s and a pullback rate of 20 or 40 mm/s. OCT-NIRAF data were analyzed to determine the distribution of the NIRAF signal with respect to OCT-delineated plaque morphological features.\nRESULTS High-quality intracoronary OCT and NIRAF image data (>50-mm pullback length) were successfully acquired without complication in all patients (17 coronary arteries). The maximum NIRAF signal intensity of each plaque was compared with OCT-deﬁned type, showing a statistically signiﬁcant difference between plaque types (1-way analysis of variance, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, coronary arterial NIRAF intensity was elevated only focally in plaques with a high-risk morphological phenotype (p < 0.05), including OCT ﬁbroatheroma, plaque rupture, and ﬁbroatheroma associated with in-stent restenosis.\nCONCLUSIONS This OCT-NIRAF study demonstrates that dual-modality microstructural and ﬂuorescence intracoronary imaging can be safely and effectively conducted in human patients.

The focal distribution of NIRAF in these lesions furthermore suggests that this endogenous imaging biomarker may provide complementary information to that obtained by structural imaging alone.

  {"id":"Valenzuela2021Assessment","abstract":"Abstract\n            Stent implantation in bifurcated coronary lesions is technically challenging so that procedural refinements are continuously investigated. Novel procedure modeling and intracoronary imaging techniques may offer critical insights on stent deformations and stent-wall interactions during bifurcation stenting procedures. Thus, we assessed coronary bifurcation stenting techniques using multimodal imaging and 3D modeling in reanimated swine hearts. Harvested swine hearts were reanimated using Visible Heart® methodologies and (under standard fluoroscopic guidance) used to test 1-stent (provisional and inverted provisional) and 2-stent (culotte, TAP and DK-crush) techniques on bifurcations within various coronary vessels using commercially available devices. Intracoronary angioscopy and frequency-domain optical-coherence-tomography (OCT) were obtained during the procedures. 3D OCT reconstruction and micro-computed tomography 3D modeling (post heart fixations) were used to assess stent deformations and stent-wall interactions. We conducted multiple stenting procedures and collected unique endoscopic and OCT images (and subsequent computational models from micro-CT) to assess stent deformations and device/wall interactions during different steps of bifurcation stenting procedures. Endoscopy, micro-CT and virtual reality processing documented that different 1- and 2-stent techniques, practiced according to experts’ recommended steps, achieve optimal post-intervention stent conformation. As compared with intra-procedural endoscopy, software-generated 3D OCT images accurately depicted stent deformations during 1-stent techniques. On the opposite, during more complex 2-stent techniques, some defects were appreciated at 3D OCT reconstruction despite optimal 2D OCT images. This study provided unique insights regarding both stent deformations occurring in the course of bifurcation stenting and the efficacy of OCT to visualize them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Valenzuela","given":"Thomas F."},{"family":"Burzotta","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Iles","given":"Tinen L."},{"family":"Lassen","given":"Jens F."},{"family":"Iaizzo","given":"Paul A."}],"citation-key":"Valenzuela2021Assessment","container-title":"The International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging","container-title-short":"Int J Cardiovasc Imaging","DOI":"10.1007/s10554-021-02240-0","ISSN":"1569-5794, 1573-0743","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"language":"en","page":"2591-2601","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessment of single and double coronary bifurcation stenting techniques using multimodal imaging and 3D modeling in reanimated swine hearts using Visible Heart® methodologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10554-021-02240-0","volume":"37"},

Both methods showed largely consistent results for the uniform phantoms. On the layered phantom, only our proposed method accurately estimated the attenuation coefﬁcients. For all phantoms, the proposed method largely reduced the variability of the estimated attenuation coefﬁcients.

  {"id":"Vokes2008Optical","abstract":"Objectives—Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new imaging modality that uses nearinfrared light to produce cross-sectional images of tissue with a resolution approaching that of light microscopy. We have previously reported use of OCT imaging of the vocal folds (VFs) during direct laryngoscopy with a probe held in contact or near-contact with the VFs. This aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel OCT system integrated with a surgical microscope to allow hands-free OCT imaging of the VFs, which could be performed simultaneously with microscopic visualization.\nMethods—We performed a prospective evaluation of a new method of acquiring OCT images of the VFs.\nResults—An OCT system was successfully integrated with a surgical microscope to permit noncontact OCT imaging of the VFs of 10 patients. With this novel device we were able to identify VF epithelium and lamina propria; however, the resolution was reduced compared to that achieved with the standard contact or near-contact OCT.\nConclusions—Optical coherence tomography is able to produce high-resolution images of vocal fold mucosa to a maximum depth of 1.6 mm. It may be used in the diagnosis of VF lesions, particularly early squamous cell carcinoma, in which OCT can show disruption of the basement membrane. Mounting the OCT device directly onto the operating microscope allows hands-free noncontact OCT imaging and simultaneous conventional microscopic visualization of the VFs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Vokes","given":"David E."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Shuguang"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Jorge A."},{"family":"Su","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Ridgway","given":"James M."},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"William B."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhongping"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Brian J.

  {"id":"Wang2018ComputerAided","abstract":"(1) Background: Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and is a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The clinical implication of subsurface glandular structures of Barrett’s esophagus is not well understood. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), also known as volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE), can assess subsurface glandular structures, which appear as subsurface hyposcattering structures (SHSs). The aim of this study is to develop a computer-aided algorithm and apply it to investigate the characteristics of SHSs in BE using clinical VLE data; (2) Methods: SHSs were identified with an initial detection followed by machine learning. Comprehensive SHS characteristics including the number, volume, depth, size and shape were quantified. Clinical VLE datasets collected from 35 patients with a history of dysplasia undergoing BE surveillance were analyzed to study the general SHS distribution and characteristics in BE. A subset of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) patient data were further analyzed to investigate the pre-RFA SHS characteristics and post-RFA treatment response; (3) Results: SHSs in the BE region were significantly shallower, more vertical, less eccentric, and more regular, as compared with squamous SHSs. SHSs in the BE region which became neosquamous epithelium after RFA were shallower than those in the regions that remained BE. Pre-ablation squamous SHSs with higher eccentricity correlated strongly with larger reduction of post-ablation BE length for less elderly patients; (4) Conclusions: The computer algorithm is potentially a valuable tool for studying the roles of SHSs in BE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hsiang-Chieh"},{"family":"Ahsen","given":"Osman"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Kaicheng"},{"family":"Figueiredo","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Fujimoto","given":"James"},{"family":"Mashimo","given":"Hiroshi"}],"citation-key":"Wang2018ComputerAided","container-title":"Applied Sciences","container-title-short":"Applied Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/app8122420","ISSN":"2076-3417","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,28]]},"language":"en","page":"2420","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Computer-Aided Analysis of Gland-Like Subsurface Hyposcattering Structures in Barrett’s Esophagus Using Optical Coherence Tomography","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/12/2420","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Wang2021Tissue","abstract":"Automatic segmentation of layered tissue is the key to esophageal optical coherence tomography (OCT) image processing. With the advent of deep learning techniques, frameworks based on a fully convolutional network are proved to be effective in classifying pixels on images. However, due to speckle noise and unfavorable imaging conditions, the esophageal tissue relevant to the diagnosis is not always easy to identify. An effective approach to address this problem is extracting more powerful feature maps, which have similar expressions for pixels in the same tissue and show discriminability from those from different tissues. In this study, we proposed a novel framework, called the tissue self-attention network (TSA-Net), which introduces the self-attention mechanism for esophageal OCT image segmentation. The self-attention module in the network is able to capture long-range context dependencies from the image and analyzes the input image in a global view, which helps to cluster pixels in the same tissue and reveal differences of different layers, thus achieving more powerful feature maps for segmentation. Experiments have visually illustrated the effectiveness of the self-attention map, and its advantages over other deep networks were also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Gan","given":"Meng"}],"citation-key":"Wang2021Tissue","container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

Using modern endoscopic examination techniques mucosal changes can be detected early on in an office-based setting. However, the further classification of these lesions requires a surgical procedure with a biopsy taken under general anesthesia. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, light-based optical tool which can provide high-resolution cross-sectional images of tissue at near microscopic resolution. Applying it through a single mode optical fiber allows endoscopic approaches. Routine endoscopic assessment and a thin epithelial layer makes the larynx the perfect organ for implementing OCT into the clinical endoscopic routine.

Sufficient sampling of the OCT imaging signal with uniform k interval are directly interpolated in the k-domain based on the spectral phase derived from MZI calibration signal.

An external clock uniform in K-space was generated. The clock was synchronized with the zero-crossing time of an interferometric calibration signal and used as triggers for a high-speed data acquisition system in a point-by-point fashion, hence enabling uniform data sampling in K-space. Different from the numerical calibration algorithm commonly used in an SS-OCT system, the method reported here does not require over-sampling, thus greatly reducing the demand for digitization, data processing and storage speed. The Rt-UKSS method is adaptive and applicable to a generic SS-OCT system of a wide range of A-scan rates without special adjustment. We successfully implemented the Rt-UKSS method in an SS-OCT system based on a Fourier-domain mode-locked laser (FDML) of a 40-kHz scanning rate.

Although researchers have proposed various methods to extend the DOF in free-space optics, many are difficult to implement in miniaturized optical probes due to space limitations. In this study, we present an optical probe with an extended DOF using a binary phase spatial filter (BPSF). The BPSF pattern was fabricated on the distal tip of an optical probe with a diameter of 1 mm by replica molding soft lithography, which can be easily implemented in a miniaturized optical probe due to its simple configuration. We optimized the BPSF pattern to enhance DOF, spot diameter, and light efficiency. To evaluate the fabricated endoscopic optical probe, we measured the three-dimensional point spread function of the BPSF probe and compared it with a probe without BPSF. The BPSF probe has a spot diameter of 3.56 μm and a DOF of 199.7 μm, while the probe without BPSF has a spot diameter of 3.69 μm and a DOF of 73.9 μm, representing a DOF gain of 2.7.

  {"id":"Yabushita2002Characterization","abstract":"Background—High-resolution visualization of atherosclerotic plaque morphology may be essential for identifying coronary plaques that cause acute coronary events. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an intravascular imaging modality capable of providing cross-sectional images of tissue with a resolution of 10 ␮m. To date, OCT imaging has not been investigated in sufficient detail to assess its accuracy for characterizing atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to establish objective OCT image criteria for atherosclerotic plaque characterization in vitro.\nMethods and Results—OCT images of 357 (diseased) atherosclerotic arterial segments obtained at autopsy were correlated with histology. OCT image criteria for 3 types of plaque were formulated by analysis of a subset (nϭ50) of arterial segments. OCT images of fibrous plaques were characterized by homogeneous, signal-rich regions; fibrocalcific plaques by well-delineated, signal-poor regions with sharp borders; and lipid-rich plaques by signal-poor regions with diffuse borders. Independent validation of these criteria by 2 OCT readers for the remaining segments (nϭ307) demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity ranging from 71% to 79% and 97% to 98% for fibrous plaques, 95% to 96% and 97% for fibrocalcific plaques, and 90% to 94% and 90% to 92% for lipid-rich plaques, respectively (overall agreement, ␬ϭ0.83 to 0.84). The interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities of OCT assessment were high (␬ values of 0.88 and 0.91, respectively).\nConclusions—Objective OCT criteria are highly sensitive and specific for characterizing different types of atherosclerotic plaques. These results represent an important step in validating this new intravascular imaging modality and will provide a basis for the interpretation of intracoronary OCT images obtained from patients.

A single 80 μm optical fiber is circularly vibrated by a piezo-electric tube to illuminate a field while the reflected light is collected to construct an image pixel-by-pixel. Accurate scanning of the optical fiber is paramount to image quality. Previously, an optical calibration chamber in the base station was used to calibrate the scanning of the optical fiber. This analytical and experimental work eliminates the use of the calibration chamber by implementing a new piezoelectric sensing approach enabling self-contained recalibration to maintain high-image quality during long medical procedures and also reducing the cost, size, and power consumption of the SFE.

  {"id":"Yuan2021Compressive","abstract":"Recently, compressive sensing has been introduced to confocal Raman imaging to accelerate data acquisition. In particular, unsupervised compressive imaging methods do not require\n              a priori\n              knowledge of an object’s spectral signatures, and they are thus applicable to unknown or dynamically changing systems. However, the current methods based on either spatial or spectral undersampling struggle between spatial and spectral fidelities at high compression ratios. By exciting a sample with an array of focused laser beams and randomly interleaving the projection locations of the scattering, we simultaneously demonstrate a single-acquisition confocal Raman hyperspectral imaging with a high fidelity and resolution in spatial and spectral domains, at a compression ratio of 40–50. The proposed method is also demonstrated with suppressed noise and a smooth transition at the boundaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Hang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Pengfei"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"Yuan2021Compressive","container-title":"Optica","container-title-short":"Optica","DOI":"10.1364/OPTICA.438826","ISSN":"2334-2536","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"1462","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Compressive hyperspectral Raman imaging via randomly interleaved scattering projection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=optica-8-11-1462","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Zagaynova2002VIVO","abstract":"Purpose: Optical coherence tomography is a new imaging modality capable of imaging luminal surface of biological tissue in the near infrared range with a spatial resolution close to the cellular level. We identified characteristic optical coherence tomography patterns for nonproliferative and proliferative inflammation, and malignant alterations of the bladder. Materials and Methods: Optical coherence tomography was performed to image the bladder of 66 patients. The probe passed through the operating channel of a cystoscope and was pressed onto the mucosal site of interest. A mucosal biopsy of the image site was obtained. Optical coherence tomography was used to construct 680 images of the bladder and the images were compared with histology slides.\nResults: Optical coherence tomography images of normal bladder showed 3 layers, namely the mucosa or transitional epithelium, submucosa and smooth muscle. In exudative processes there were poor light scattering areas in the connective tissue layer. Images of bladders with proliferative cystitis revealed nonuniform thickening of the epithelium or hyperplasia. Squamous metaplasia appeared as thicker and less transparent epithelium with a jagged boundary. Images of transitional cell carcinoma were characterized by the complete loss of a regular layered structure of the bladder wall and the penetration depth of optical imaging was slight.\nConclusions: This study provides the characteristic optical coherence tomography pattern of nonproliferative and proliferative inflammation, and the characteristic appearance of severe dysplasia and transitional cell carcinoma. This technique may be useful as a guide for biopsy and for assisting in establishing resection margins.","author":[{"family":"Zagaynova","given":"Elena V"},{"family":"Streltsova","given":"Olga S"},{"family":"Gladkova","given":"Natalia D"},{"family":"Snopova","given":"Ludmila B"},{"family":"Gelikonov","given":"Grigory V"},{"family":"Feldchtein","given":"Felix I"},{"family":"Morozov","given":"Andrey N"}],"citation-key":"Zagaynova2002VIVO","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"5","source":"Zotero","title":"IN VIVO OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY FEASIBILITY FOR BLADDER DISEASE","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Zammit2020Adaptive","abstract":"Adaptive block-based compressive sensing (ABCS) algorithms are studied in the context of the practical realisation of compressive sensing on resource-constrained image and video sensing platforms that use single-pixel cameras, multi-pixel cameras or focal plane processing sensors. In this paper, we introduce two novel ABCS algorithms that are suitable for compressively sensing images or intra-coded video frames. Both use deterministic 2D-DCT dictionaries when sensing the images instead of random dictionaries. The ﬁrst uses a low number of compressive measurements to compute the block boundary variation (BBV) around each image block, from which it estimates the number of 2D-DCT transform coefﬁcients to measure from each block. The second uses a low number of DCT domain (DD) measurements to estimate the total number of transform coefﬁcients to capture from each block. The two algorithms permit reconstruction in real time, averaging 8 ms and 26 ms for 256 × 256 and 512 × 512 greyscale images, respectively, using a simple inverse 2D-DCT operation without requiring GPU acceleration. Furthermore, we show that an iterative compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm (IDA), inspired by the denoisingbased approximate message passing algorithm, can be used as a post-processing, quality enhancement technique. IDA trades off real-time operation to yield performance improvement over state-of-the-art GPUassisted algorithms of 1.31 dB and 0.0152 in terms of PSNR and SSIM, respectively.

It becomes especially critical if the measurements acquired with different instruments need to be compared, or precise volumetric data are needed for monitoring and treatment of retinal disease. On the other hand, it is well understood that optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are distorted by several factors. Only limited work has been performed to eliminate these problems in ophthalmic retinal imaging, perhaps because they are less evident in the more common 2D representation mode of time-domain OCT. With recent progress in imaging speed of Fourier domain OCT (Fd-OCT) techniques, however, 3D OCT imaging is more frequently being used, thereby exposing problems that have been ignored previously. In this paper we propose possible solutions to minimize and compensate for artifacts caused by subject eye and head motion, and distortions caused by the geometry of the scanning optics. The first is corrected by cross-correlation based B-scan registration techniques; the second is corrected by incorporating the geometry of the scanning beam into custom volume rendering software. Retinal volumes of optical nerve head (ONH) and foveal regions of healthy volunteer, with and without corrections, are presented. Finally, some common factors that may lead to increased distortions of the ophthalmic OCT image such as refractive error or position of the subject’s head are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zawadzki","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Alfred R."},{"family":"Choi","given":"Stacey S."},{"family":"Wiley","given":"David F."},{"family":"Hamann","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Werner","given":"John S."}],"citation-key":"Zawadzki2007Correctiona","DOI":"10.1117/12.701524","editor":[{"family":"Manns","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Soederberg","given":"Per G."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Stuck","given":"Bruce E."},{"family":"Belkin","given":"Michael"}],"event-place":"San Jose, CA","event-title":"Biomedical Optics (BiOS) 2007","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,2,8]]},"language":"en","page":"642607","publisher-place":"San Jose, CA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Correction of motion artifacts and scanning beam distortions in 3D ophthalmic optical coherence tomography imaging","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1117/12.701524"},

Speciﬁcally, we propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a general ℓ1 norm CS reconstruction model. To cast ISTA into deep network form, we develop an effective strategy to solve the proximal mapping associated with the sparsity-inducing regularizer using nonlinear transforms. All the parameters in ISTA-Net (e.g. nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step sizes, etc.) are learned end-to-end, rather than being hand-crafted. Moreover, considering that the residuals of natural images are more compressible, an enhanced version of ISTA-Net in the residual domain, dubbed ISTA-Net+, is derived to further improve CS reconstruction. Extensive CS experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISTA-Nets outperform existing state-of-the-art optimization-based and networkbased CS methods by large margins, while maintaining fast computational speed.

Here, we report the development of a video-rate dual-modal photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence microscopy probe with a high-speed digital micromirror device (DMD) towards forward-viewing endomicroscopy. Optimal DMD patterns were obtained using a real-valued intensity transmission matrix algorithm to raster-scan a 1.5 μm-diameter focused beam at the distal fibre tip for imaging. The PA imaging speed and spatial resolution were varied from ∼2 to 57 frames per second and from 1.7 to 3 μm, respectively. Further, high-fidelity PA images of carbon fibres and mouse red blood cells were acquired at unprecedented speed. The capability of dual-modal imaging was demonstrated with phantoms. We anticipate that with further miniaturisation of the ultrasound detector, this probe could be integrated into medical needles to guide minimally invasive procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Tianrui"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Michelle T."},{"family":"Ourselin","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Vercauteren","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Wenfeng"}],"citation-key":"Zhao2022Videorate","container-title":"Photoacoustics","container-title-short":"Photoacoustics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pacs.2021.100323","ISSN":"22135979","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3]]},"language":"en","page":"100323","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Video-rate dual-modal photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging through a multimode fibre towards forward-viewing endomicroscopy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213597921000811","volume":"25"},

A key unmet challenge is its limited throughput especially compared to rapid wide-field modalities that are used ubiquitously in thin specimens. Wide-field imaging methods in tissue specimens have found successes in optically cleared tissues and at shallower depths, but the scattering of emission photons in thick turbid samples severely degrades image quality at the camera. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel technique called De-scattering with Excitation Patterning or “DEEP,” which uses patterned nonlinear excitation followed by computational imaging–assisted wide-field detection. Multiphoton temporal focusing allows high-resolution excitation patterns to be projected deep inside specimen at multiple scattering lengths due to the use of long wavelength light. Computational reconstruction allows high-resolution structural features to be reconstructed from tens to hundreds of DEEP images instead of millions of point-scanning measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Park","given":"Jong Kang"},{"family":"Yildirim","given":"Murat"},{"family":"Boivin","given":"Josiah R."},{"family":"Xue","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Sur","given":"Mriganka"},{"family":"So","given":"Peter T.

  {"id":"Zhou2020Alloptical","abstract":"This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a novel all-optical fiber ultrasound imaging system based on the photoacoustic (PA) ultrasound generation principle and Fabry-Perot interferometer principle for biomedical imaging applications. This system consists of a fiber optic ultrasound generator and a Fabry–Perot (FP) fiber sensor receiver. A carbon black polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material was utilized as the photoacoustic material for the fiber optic ultrasound generator. The black PDMS material was coated on the tip of a 1000 μm core size multimode fiber (MMF) to generate the ultrasound signal. Two layers of gold, PDMS and a single mode fiber (SMF) were used to build the FP fiber sensor receiver. The system verification test proves the ultrasound sensing capability. The biomedical imaging test validates the ultrasound imaging capability. There are many advantages of this all-optical fiber ultrasound imaging system, such as small size, light weight, ease of use, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. This research has revealed valuable knowledge for the further study of biomedical imaging in a limited space, e.g., catheter based intravascular imaging, tissue characterization, tissue identification and related biomedical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jingcheng"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Rinkal"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Du","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingwei"}],"citation-key":"Zhou2020Alloptical","container-title":"Medical Imaging 2020: Ultrasonic Imaging and Tomography","DOI":"10.1117/12.2564494","event-title":"Medical Imaging 2020: Ultrasonic Imaging and Tomography","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"page":"237-242","publisher":"SPIE","source":"www.spiedigitallibrary.org","title":"All-optical fiber ultrasound imaging system based on the photoacoustic principle","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11319/1131915/All-optical-fiber-ultrasound-imaging-system-based-on-the-photoacoustic/10.1117/12.2564494.full","volume":"11319"},

  {"id":"Zou2022Concise","abstract":"High-dimensional signal recovery of standard linear regression is a key challenge in many engineering ﬁelds, such as, communications, compressed sensing, and image processing. The approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm proposed by Donoho et al is a computational efﬁcient method to such problems, which can attain Bayes-optimal performance in independent identical distributed (IID) sub-Gaussian random matrices region. A signiﬁcant feature of AMP is that the dynamical behavior of AMP can be fully predicted by a scalar equation termed station evolution (SE). Although AMP is optimal in IID sub-Gaussian random matrices, AMP may fail to converge when measurement matrix is beyond IID sub-Gaussian. To extend the region of random measurement matrix, an expectation propagation (EP)-related algorithm orthogonal AMP (OAMP) was proposed, which shares the same algorithm with EP, expectation consistent (EC), and vector AMP (VAMP). This paper aims at giving a review for those algorithms. We begin with the worst case, i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) inference problem, and then give the detailed derivation of AMP derived from message passing. Also, in the Bayes-optimal setting, we give the Bayes-optimal AMP which has a slight difference from AMP for LASSO. In addition, we review some AMP-related algorithms: OAMP, VAMP, and Memory AMP (MAMP), which can be applied to more general random matrices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zou","given":"Qiuyun"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Hongwen"}],"citation-key":"Zou2022Concise","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2201.07487","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Concise Tutorial on Approximate Message Passing","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07487"},
  {"id":"Zunino2022Reconstructing","abstract":"Confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) is one of the most popular optical architectures for ﬂuorescence imaging. In CLSM, a focused laser beam excites the ﬂuorescence emission from a speciﬁc specimen position. Some actuators scan the probed region across the sample and a photodetector collects a single intensity value for each scan point, building a two-dimensional image pixel-by-pixel. Recently, new fast single-photon array detectors have allowed the recording of a full bi-dimensional image of the probed region for each scan point, transforming CLSM into image scanning microscopy (ISM). This latter oﬀers signiﬁcant improvements over traditional imaging but requires an optimal processing tool to extract a super-resolved image from the four-dimensional dataset. Here we describe the image formation process in ISM from a statistical point of view, and we use the Bayesian framework to formulate a multi-image deconvolution problem. Notably, the single-photon detector suﬀers exclusively from the photon shot noise, enabling the development of an eﬀective likelihood model. We derive an iterative likelihood maximization algorithm and test it on experimental and simulated data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ISM dataset is redundant, enabling the possibility of obtaining reconstruction sampled at twice the scanning step. Our results prove that in ISM, under appropriate conditions, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterium is eﬀectively relaxed. This ﬁnding can be exploited to speed up the acquisition process by a factor of four, further improving the versatility of ISM systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zunino","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Castello","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Vicidomini","given":"Giuseppe"}],"citation-key":"Zunino2022Reconstructing","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2211.12510","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Reconstructing the Image Scanning Microscopy Dataset: an Inverse Problem","title-short":"Reconstructing the Image Scanning Microscopy Dataset","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12510"},
