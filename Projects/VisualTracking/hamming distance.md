### Calculation of Hamming Distance

In order to calculate the Hamming distance between two strings, and , we perform their XOR operation, (a $\oplus$ b), and then count the total number of 1s in the resultant string [[#^eb0c73]].

### ExampleÂ 

Suppose there are two strings 1101 1001 and 1001 1101.

11011001 $\oplus$ 10011101 = 01000100. Since, this contains two 1s, the Hamming distance, d(11011001, 10011101) = 2 [[#^eb0c73]].  [ref1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-hamming-distance)
