### Scanning Optics

#### Pre-Objective vs Post-Objective Scanning

1. **Image Plane:** Pre-objective scanning creates a flat image plane, while post-objective scanning results in a curved image field.
    
2. **Misalignment Sensitivity:** Post-objective scanning is more sensitive to misalignment than pre-objective scanning.
    
3. **Lens Position:** In pre-objective scanning, the corrected and modulated beam enters the scanning lens before creating the scan spot, whereas in post-objective scanning, the scanning system is situated in the convergent beam from the focusing lens. [[@Ray2002Applied]]
