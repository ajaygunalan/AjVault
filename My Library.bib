  abstract = {Introduced in 2008, the femtosecond laser is a promising new technological advance which plays an ever increasing role in cataract surgery where it automates the three main surgical steps: corneal incision, capsulotomy and lens fragmentation. The proven advantages over manual surgery are: a better quality of incision with reduced induced astigmatism; increased reliability and reproducibility of the capsulotomy with increased stability of the implanted lens; a reduction in the use of ultrasound. Regarding refractive results or safety, however, no prospective randomized study to date has shown significant superiority compared with standard manual technique. The significant extra cost generated by this laser, undertaken by the patient, is a limiting factor for both its use and study. This review outlines the potential benefits of femtosecondlaser-assisted cataract surgery due to the automation of key steps and the safety of this new technology.},

  abstract = {Scanning lasers increase the quality of the laser microsurgery enabling fast tissue ablation with less thermal damage. However, the possibility to perform scanning laser microsurgery in confined workspaces is restricted by the large size of currently available actuators, which are typically located outside the patient and require direct line-of-sight to the microsurgical area. Here, a magnetic scanner tool is designed to allow endoscopic scanning laser microsurgery. The tool consists of two miniature electromagnetic coil pairs and permanent magnets attached to a flexible optical fiber. The actuation mechanism is based on the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the permanent magnets. Controlled and high-speed laser scanning is achieved by bending of the optical fiber with magnetic torque. Results demonstrate the achievement of a 3\texttimes 3 mm2 scanning range within the laser spot is controlled with 35{$\mu$}m precision. The system is also capable of automatically executing high-speed laser scanning operations over customized trajectories with a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) in the order of 75{$\mu$}m. Furthermore, it can be teleoperated in real-time using any appropriate user interface device. This new technology enables laser scanning in narrow and difficult to reach workspaces, promising to bring the benefits of scanning laser microsurgery to laparoscopic or even flexible endoscopic procedures. In addition, the same technology can be potentially used for optical fiber based imaging, enabling for example the creation of new family of scanning endoscopic OCT or hyperspectral probes.},

Methods 74 OCT datasets with correlated biopsy/endoscopic mucosal resection histology (49 nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus [NDBE], 25 neoplasia) were obtained from 14 patients with Barrett's esophagus and a history of dysplasia and 30 with NDBE. The associations between irregular mucosal patterns on en face OCT, absence of mucosal layering, surface signal {$>$} subsurface, and {$>$} 5 atypical glands on cross-sectional OCT vs. histology and treatment history were assessed by three blinded readers. Results Atypical glands under irregular mucosal patterns occurred in 75 \% of neoplasia (96 \% of treatment-na\"ive neoplasia) vs. 30 \% of NDBE datasets (43 \% of short- and 18 \% of long-segment NDBE). Mucosal layering was absent in 35 \% of neoplasia and 50 \% of NDBE datasets, and surface signal {$>$} subsurface occurred in 29 \% of neoplasia and 30 \% of NDBE datasets. Conclusions Atypical glands under irregular mucosal patterns are strongly associated with neoplasia, suggesting potential markers for dysplasia and a role in pathogenesis.},

This article provides a comparative analysis and review based on quantitative and qualitative criteria of the two main streams of tongue contour segmentation from ultrasound images. The first stream utilizes traditional computer vision and image processing algorithms for tongue segmentation. The second stream uses machine and deep learning algorithms for tongue segmentation. The results show that tongue tracking using machine learning-based techniques is superior to traditional techniques, considering the performance and algorithm generalization ability. Meanwhile, traditional techniques are helpful for implementing interactive image segmentation to extract valuable features during training and postprocessing. We recommend using a hybrid approach to combine machine learning and traditional techniques to implement a real-time tongue segmentation tool.},

On these databases, the proposed approach exhibits an optimal compromise between robustness, accuracy and computation speed. Numerous tests performed both on complicated data of the reference databases and on challenging endoscopic images acquired under three different modalities demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the method against the presence of large or small displacements, weak texture information, varying illumination conditions and modality changes.},

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance has been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after PCI, principally by resulting in a larger postprocedure lumen than with angiographic guidance. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides higher resolution imaging than does IVUS, although findings from some studies suggest that it might lead to smaller luminal diameters after stent implantation. We sought to establish whether or not a novel OCT-based stent sizing strategy would result in a minimum stent area similar to or better than that achieved with IVUS guidance and better than that achieved with angiography guidance alone.},

We show that the strategy of warping the multi-channel dense feature image at each iteration is more beneficial than extracting features after warping the intensity image at each iteration. Motivated by this observation, we demonstrate robust and accurate alignment and fitting performance using a variety of powerful feature descriptors. Especially with the employment of HOG and SIFT features, our method significantly outperforms the current stateof-the-art results on in-the-wild databases.},

The NVB was imaged again in vivo, after the prostate was excised. Ex-vivo images were obtained from the prostate surface to look for the presence or absence of the NVBs and correlated with the surgeon's assessment of the adequacy of nerve sparing.},

Barrett's esophagus is the precursor to EAC. Currently, endoscopically obtained biopsies are used to detect neoplastic changes in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE); however, it is not cost effective and hence a better screening modality is needed. Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) has been under study for the past few years and has shown promising results to overcome the shortcoming faced in the biopsy samplings. It is a second-generation optical coherence tomography (OCT) that provides high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of the esophageal mucosa using near-infrared light. The principle is similar to endosonography, but image formation in OCT depends on variations in the reflection of light from different tissue layers rather than ultrasonic waves.},

A new fabrication process based on SOI wafer, hybrid bulk/surface micromachined technology, and a high-aspect-ratio shadow mask is presented. In comparison to previous fabrication processes and the Optical iMEMS process, the process is novel, easily understood, and simple to realize. The measured maximum angular deflection achieved is {$\pm$}11\textdegree (mechanical angle) at a static operating voltage and is {$\pm$} 21\textdegree (mechanical angle) at resonance frequency driving. This mirror is well suited for applications where these characteristics are critical, such as in confocal or endoscopic scanning elements},

We therefore demonstrate a DCFC-based system combining OCT imaging with laser coagulation through a single fiber, thus enabling both modalities to be performed simultaneously and in a co-registered manner.

  abstract = {Introduction: Benign vocal disorders in children include an extensive list of abnormalities creating a variety of debilitating levels of dysphonia. Precise delineation of the benign lesion type and margins may have significant public health implications in children. An innovative technology such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being explored to delineate pediatric benign laryngeal lesions. An accurate assessment of the subepithelial morphology may help towards tailoring more personalized therapeutic treatments. This study was established to highlight key morphological and optical features of benign pediatric laryngeal lesions using intraoperative OCT and to suggest clinical implications that arise from such optical imaging. Methods and materials: This in vivo study was performed at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Intraoperative imaging was performed on twenty-five pediatric patients ranging from 1 year to 16 years of age presenting hoarseness. Three-dimensional OCT images of benign laryngeal lesions or a subsite of the lesion were acquired. Results: High-resolution OCT images of 25 patients with benign laryngeal lesions such as nodules, cysts, Reinke's edema, vocalis sulcus, and papilloma revealed distinct and specific morphological differences with normal tissue. Nodules show a symmetrical superficial remodeling of the vocal fold epithelial layer and the basement membrane. Cysts have oval-like shape and are either superficial or deeply located in the lamina propria. Sulcus vocalis OCT imaging allows characterizing if the lesion is shallow or deep according to Ford's classification system. Reinke's edema of the mucosa can be observed and quantified, which may lead to suspicion on the underlying social and medical conditions. Finally, the ability to assess margins and depth of invasion of papilloma lesions is demonstrated, raising the possibility to use OCT with angiolytic lasers for patient-tailored treatments. Conclusions: OCT imaging of benign pediatric vocal lesions is promising as it could improve preoperative decision-making and possibly peroperative imaging-guidance for patient-tailored treatments. An assessment of the optical contrast between healthy and abnormal tissue may help towards a more qualitative and quantitative approach to current standard care, especially when diagnosis remains unclear.},

  abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Identifying distinctive features of the vocal fold (VF) during development could have significant clinical implications for treating voice disorders. This study investigates the structural organization of the VF microanatomy across gender and age groups using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Study Design: Prospective clinical trial. Materials and Methods: In vivo OCT images were acquired from 97 patients (58 males and 39 females) aged between 6 weeks and 27 years. All patients showed no signs of vocal fold pathology on endoscopy. Morphological features were extracted from OCT images and statistically compared between age groups. This study was performed at Massachusetts Eye and Ear between 2017 and 2019. Results: All OCT acquisitions show a stratified microanatomy across age groups, even in newborns suggesting the presence of a superficial lamina propria (SLP) at birth. Furthermore, the optical scattering in the VF lamina propria changes according to age, suggesting subepithelial maturation. Although the epithelium thickness was relatively constant across age groups, the SLP showed a significant linear relationship between age and thickness (P = .016). Furthermore, a significant difference (P = .002) in SLP thickness was found between young adult males and females. The overall thickness of the entire mucosa did not change significantly with age. Conclusion: OCT is a noninvasive imaging modality capable of providing quantitative morphological features to describe the VF development. A stratified structure can be observed in OCT from newborns to young adults. Further investigations could combine OCT, acoustic measurements, and molecular sensitive techniques to provide a complete interpretation of the VF development.},

  abstract = {Broadly speaking, time-resolved phenomena refers to three dimensional capture of a scene based on the time-of-flight principle. Since speed and and time are proportional quantities, knowing time-of-flight allows one to estimate distances. This time-of-flight may be attributed to a pulse of light or a wave packet of sound. Depending on the sub-band of the electromagnetic spectrum, the interaction of waves or pulses with the scene of interest results in measurements and based on this proxy of the physical world, one is interested in inferring physical properties of the scene. This may be something simple as depth, or something more involved such as fluorescence lifetime of a biological sample or the diffusion coefficient of turbid/scattering medium. The goal of this work is to develop a unifying approach to study time-resolved phenomena across various sub-bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, devise algorithms to solve for the corresponding inverse problems and provide fundamental limits. Sampling theory, which deals with the interplay between the discrete and the continuous realms, plays a critical role in this work due to the continuous nature of physical world and the discrete nature of its proxy, that is, the time-resolved measurements.},

Both 2PE and STED are beam scanning techniques. The image acquisition is commonly realized by raster scanning, and a pair of galvanometric mirrors are the most used approach. In 2PE fluorescence microscopy, acousto-optical deflectors (AODs) are also used because they allow random-access scanning. However, since the AOD working principle is diffraction of light, these devices are of limited use when it is necessary to deflect multiple beams of different wavelengths and polarization, e.g. in STED nanoscopy. Here, we present the first implementation of single wavelength 2PE-STED that enables a smart beam scanning system based on AODs technology.},

  abstract = {Vitreoretinal surgery concerns a set of particularly demanding minimal invasive micro-surgical interventions at the retina. Micro-surgeons are targeting sub-millimeter-sized structures here. Tiny vessels or wafer-thin membranes are to be cannulated or need to be peeled off. The greatest care is to be displayed not to damage these fragile structures or to inadvertently injure the underlying retina. Damage to the latter is mostly irreparable and might cause permanent loss of vision. Despite the availability over excellent stereo microscopes, wide-angle lenses and powerful light source visualization remains a problem. Especially, the limited depth perception is still perceived as a major bottle-neck whereas efforts have been conducted to integrate sensing capability in today's state-of-the-art instruments, so far, little effort has been paid to process the obtained sensor data and turns this into a reliable source of information upon which robot assistive guidance schemes could be endowed upon. This paper proposes a number of processing techniques tailored to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) measurements. The first results of the proposed algorithms show that it is feasible to extract good and reliable distance estimates from this otherwise rather noisy signal and from a fairly limited dataset. The used data are the so-called A-scans. These are OCT measurements consisting of a single-line image that could be captured by an instrument-mounted fiber through which the OCT signal passes back-and-forth. However, in this work, we perform a pilot study whereby the employed A-scans are extracted from B-scans that are captured by a microscope-mounted OCT scanner, rather than obtained from a probe. The performance of a first embodiment of the algorithm that is based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is compared to the performance of a second embodiment that relies on a Particle Filter (PF), focusing on the issues in filter initialization and the tracking quality. Finally, results of UKF and PF executions on a validation dataset are presented.},

Gradient-based approaches for image/object alignment have many desirable properties \textendash{} inference is typically fast and exact, and diverse constraints can be imposed on the motion of points. However, the presumption that gradients predicted on sparse features would be poor estimators of the true descent direction has meant that gradient-based optimization is often overlooked in favour of graph-based optimization. We show that this intuition is only partly true: sparse features are indeed poor predictors of the error surface, but this has no impact on the actual alignment performance. In fact, for general object categories that exhibit large geometric and appearance variation, sparse features are integral to achieving any convergence whatsoever. How the descent directions are predicted becomes an important consideration for these descriptors. We explore a number of strategies for estimating gradients, and show that estimating gradients via regression in a manner that explicitly handles outliers improves alignment performance substantially. To illustrate the general applicability of gradient-based methods to the alignment of challenging object categories, we perform unsupervised ensemble alignment on a series of non-rigid animal classes from ImageNet.},

While coarse-to-fine warping schemes have somehow relaxed this constraint, there is an inherent dependency between the scale of structures and the velocity that can be estimated. This particularly renders the estimation of detailed human motion problematic, as small body parts can move very fast. In this paper, we present a way to approach this problem by integrating rich descriptors into the variational optical flow setting. This way we can estimate a dense optical flow field with almost the same high accuracy as known from variational optical flow, while reaching out to new domains of motion analysis where the requirement of dense sampling in time is no longer satisfied.},

In the field of fluorescence microscopy, it has been demonstrated to be valuable for fast and high-resolution imaging, from singlemolecule localization, super-resolution to light-sheet microscopy. Furthermore, CS has found remarkable applications in the field of mesoscopic imaging, facilitating the study of small animals' organs and entire organisms. This review article illustrates the working principles of CS, its implementations in optical imaging and discusses several relevant uses of CS in the field of fluorescence imaging from superresolution microscopy to mesoscopy.},

The widespread clinical adoption of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in ophthalmology and its growing prominence in other fields, such as cancer imaging, has motivated the development of intraoperative OCT for real-time tomographic visualization of surgical interventions. This article reviews key technological developments in intraoperative OCT and their applications in human surgery. We focus on handheld OCT probes, microscope-integrated OCT systems, and OCT-guided laser treatment platforms designed for intraoperative use. Moreover, we discuss intraoperative OCT adjuncts and processing techniques currently under development to optimize the surgical feedback derivable from OCT data.

  abstract = {Methods to reduce the high disability and fatality rate of neurosurgery caused by surgeon tremor and uncertainty of intraoperative tumor boundary have long been greatly concerned. We have proposed an intelligent theranostics method for a compact integrated diagnosis and therapeutic platform to automatically excise the brain tumor with high precision. To perform this operation, hardware combination of a benchtop spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and a high-power laser has been implemented by a customized fiber combiner. By the double-clad fiber out of the combiner which works as both the OCT sample arm fiber and the ablation laser output fiber, an in situ theranostics process without registration can be conducted. The SD-OCT image analysis from both en face and depth perspectives shows the structural information intuitively and accordingly generate the ablation-guiding grid. Based on the grid, the continuous wave high-power laser ablates ex vivo porcine brain models in submillimeter automatically. The feasibility of this theranostics method has been verified by the comparison of attenuation maps before and after ablation, and the contrast of its pathology.},

  abstract = {Reducing acquisition time is a crucial challenge for many imaging techniques. Compressed sensing (CS) theory offers an appealing framework to address this issue since it provides theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction of sparse signals by projection on a low-dimensional linear subspace. In this paper, we focus on a setting where the imaging device allows us to sense a fixed set of measurements. We first discuss the choice of an optimal sampling subspace allowing perfect reconstruction of sparse signals. Its design relies on the random drawing of independent measurements. We discuss how to select the drawing distribution and show that a mixed strategy involving partial deterministic sampling and independent drawings can help in breaking the so-called coherence barrier. Unfortunately, independent random sampling is irrelevant for many acquisition devices owing to acquisition constraints. To overcome this limitation, the notion of a variable density sampler (VDS) is introduced and defined as a stochastic process with a prescribed limit empirical measure. It encompasses samplers based on independent measurements or continuous curves. The latter are crucial to extend CS results to actual applications. We propose two original approaches to designing a continuous VDS, one based on random walks over the acquisition space and one based on the travelling salesman problem. Following theoretical considerations and retrospective CS simulations in magnetic resonance imaging, we intend to highlight the key properties of a VDS to ensure accurate sparse reconstructions, namely its limit empirical measure and its mixing time.},

To achieve micron-order precision control, a reliable and accurate OCT distal sensing method is required; simultaneously, a prediction algorithm is necessary to compensate for the system delay associated with the computational, mechanical and electronic latencies. Due to the multilayered structure of retina, it is necessary to develop effective surface detection methods rather than simple peak detection. To achieve this, a shifted cross-correlation method is applied for surface detection in order to increase robustness and accuracy in distal sensing. A predictor based on Kalman filter was implemented for more precise motion compensation. The performance was first evaluated using an established dry phantom consisting of stacked cellophane tape. This was followed by evaluation in an ex-vivo bovine retina model to assess system accuracy and precision. The results demonstrate highly accurate depth targeting with less than 5 {$\mu$}m RMSE depth locking.},

In this work, we describe an optical imaging method to obtain high-resolution cross-sectional imaging using a paddle-shaped probe affixed to the endoscope tip. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We integrated Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), an optical imaging method that produces cross-sectional images, into a paddle probe attached to video endoscope. We acquired images of esophageal epithelium from patients undergoing routine upper GI endoscopy. Images were classified by a reviewer blinded to patient identity and condition, and these results were compared with clinical diagnosis. Results\hspace{0.6em} We successfully captured epithelial OCT images from 30 patients and identified features consistent with both squamous epithelium and Barrett's esophagus. Our blinded image reviewer classified BE versus non-BE with 91.5\% accuracy (65/71 image regions), including sensitivity of 84.6\% for BE (11/13) and a specificity of 93.1\% (54/58). However, in 16 patients, intubation of the probe into the esophagus could not be achieved. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} A paddle probe is a feasible imaging format for acquiring cross-sectional OCT images from the esophagus and can provide a structural assessment of BE and non-BE tissue. Probe form factor is the current limiting obstacle, but could be addressed by further miniaturization.},

  abstract = {Depth perception remains a key challenge in vitreoretinal surgery. Currently users only have the view from an overhead stereo-microscope available, but this means of visualisation is quite restrictive. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has been introduced in the past and is even integrated in a number of commercial systems to provide a more detailed depth vision, even showing subsurface structures up to a few millimeters below the surface. The intra-operative use of OCT, especially in combination with robotics, is still sub-optimal. At present one can get either a very slowly updating large volume scan (C-scan) or a faster but not aligned cross-sectional B-scan or an even more local single point A-scan at very high update rate. In this work we propose a model-mediated approach. As the posterior eye segment can be approximated as a sphere, we propose to model the retina with this simplified sphere model, the center and radius of which can be estimated in real time. A time-varying Kalman filter is proposed here in combination with an instrument-integrated optical fiber that provides high-frequency A-scans along the longitudinal instrument direction. The model and convergence of the model has been validated first in a simulation environment and subsequently in-silico using an OCT A-scan probe mounted on a co-manipulated vitreoretinal robotic system. The probe was manipulated to measure a 3D stereo lithographically printed spherical model of the posterior eye segment. The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated in various scenarios. For the in-silico validation a 20 micrometer error and convergence speed of 2.0 seconds was found when sampling A-scans at 200Hz.},

We assume that a small set of reference images of the environment and a partial 3D model are available. Like previous approaches, we register the input images by aligning them with one of the reference images using the 3D information. However, these approaches typically rely on the pixel intensities for the alignment, which is prone to fail in presence of specularities or in absence of texture. Our main contribution is an efficient novel local descriptor that we use to describe each image location. We show that we can rely on this descriptor in place of the intensities to significantly improve the alignment robustness at a minor increase of the computational cost, and we analyze the reasons behind the success of our descriptor.},

  abstract = {Capsule endoscopy (CE) has proved to be a powerful tool in the diagnosis and management of small bowel disorders since its introduction in 2001. However, white light imaging (WLI) is the principal technology used in clinical CE at present, and therefore, CE is limited to mucosal inspection, with diagnosis remaining reliant on visible manifestations of disease. The introduction of WLI CE has motivated a wide range of research to improve its diagnostic capabilities through integration with other sensing modalities. These developments have the potential to overcome the limitations of WLI through enhanced detection of subtle mucosal microlesions and submucosal and/or transmural pathology{$\mkern1mu$}, providing novel diagnostic avenues. Other research aims to utilize a range of sensors to measure physiological parameters or to discover new biomarkers to improve the sensitivity{$\mkern1mu$}, specificity and thus the clinical utility of CE. This multidisciplinary Review summarizes research into non-W LI CE devices by organizing them into a taxonomic structure on the basis of their sensing modality. The potential of these capsules to realize clinically useful virtual biopsy and computer-a ided diagnosis (CADx) is also reported.},

Methods: We review the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of BE, with an emphasis on the most current endoscopic diagnostic modalities for BE. Results: Novel diagnostic modalities have emerged to address the inadequacies of standard, untargeted biopsies, such as dye-based and virtual chromoendoscopy, endoscopic mucosal resection, molecular biomarkers, optical coherence tomography, confocal laser endomicroscopy, volumetric laser endomicroscopy, and endocytoscopy. Treatment of BE depends on the presence of intramucosal cancer or dysplasia, particularly high-grade dysplasia with or without visible mucosal lesions. Conclusions: Recent advances in endoscopic diagnostic tools demonstrate promising results and help to mitigate the shortcomings of the Seattle protocol. Future research as well as refining these tools may help aid them in replacing standard untargeted biopsies.},

  abstract = {Most image registration problems are formulated in an asymmetric fashion. Given a pair of images, one is implicitly or explicitly regarded as a template and warped onto the other to match as well as possible. In this paper, we focus on this seemingly arbitrary choice of the roles and reveal how it may lead to biased warp estimates in the presence of relative scaling. We present a principled way of selecting the template and explain why only the correct asymmetric form, with the potential inclusion of a blurring step, can yield an unbiased estimator. We validate our analysis in the domain of model-based face tracking. We show how the usual Active Appearance Model (AAM) formulation overlooks the asymmetry issue, causing the fitting accuracy to degrade quickly when the observed objects are smaller than their model. We formulate a novel, ``resolution-aware fitting'' (RAF) algorithm that respects the asymmetry and incorporates an explicit model of the blur caused by the camera's sensing elements into the fitting formulation. We compare the RAF algorithm against a state-ofthe-art tracker across a variety of resolutions and AAM complexity levels. Experimental results show that RAF significantly improves the estimation accuracy of both shape and appearance parameters when fitting to low-resolution data. Recognizing and accounting for the asymmetry of image registration leads to tangible accuracy improvements in analyzing low-resolution imagery.},

  abstract = {Dynamic biological systems present challenges to existing three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopes because of their continuous temporal and spatial changes. Most techniques are rigid in adapting the acquisition parameters over time, as in confocal microscopy, where a laser beam is sequentially scanned at a predefined spatial sampling rate and pixel dwell time. Such lack of tunability forces a user to provide scan parameters, which may not be optimal, based on the best assumption before an acquisition starts. Here, we developed volumetric Lissajous confocal microscopy to achieve unsurpassed 3D scanning speed with a tunable sampling rate. The system combines an acoustic liquid lens for continuous axial focus translation with a resonant scanning mirror. Accordingly, the excitation beam follows a dynamic Lissajous trajectory enabling submillisecond acquisitions of image series containing 3D information at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. By temporal accumulation and/or advanced interpolation algorithms, the volumetric imaging rate is selectable using a post-processing step at the desired spatiotemporal resolution for events of interest. We demonstrate multicolor and calcium imaging over volumes of tens of cubic microns with 3D acquisition speeds of 30 Hz and frame rates up to 5 kHz.},

Here, we demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility and safety of TCE and a portable OCT imaging system in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) in a multi-center (5-site) clinical study. METHODS: Untreated patients with BE as per endoscopic biopsy diagnosis were eligible to participate in the study. TCE procedures were performed in unsedated patients by either doctors or nurses. After the capsule was swallowed, the device continuously obtained 10-mm-resolution crosssectional images as it traversed the esophagus. Following imaging, the device was withdrawn through mouth, and disinfected for subsequent reuse. BE lengths were compared to endoscopy findings when available. OCT-TCE images were compared to volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) images from a patient who had undergone VLE on the same day as TCE. RESULTS: 147 patients with BE were enrolled across all sites. 116 swallowed the capsule (79\%), 95/114 (83.3\%) men and 21/33 (63.6\%) women (P [ .01). High-quality OCT images were obtained in 104/111 swallowers (93.7\%) who completed the procedure. The average imaging duration was 5.55 \textendash{} 1.92 minutes. The mean length of esophagus imaged per patient was 21.69 \textendash{} 5.90 cm. A blinded comparison of maximum extent of BE measured by OCT-TCE and EGD showed a strong correlation (r [ 0.77-0.79). OCT-TCE images were of similar quality to those obtained by OCT-VLE. CONCLUSIONS:},

The main objective is to reduce the acquisition time (i.e., increase the frame rate) of an OCT-scan system by choosing a trajectory that covers entirely the image but that does not take all the measurements. The reconstruction of the missing data is achieved by applying an updated Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) on a sparse representation of the image. Several sparse representations have been tested and the shearlets-based approach seems to outperform the other ones (e.g. wavelets, curvelets and by applying bilinear interpolation). The targeted application is a fast OCT imaging solution allowing an efficient compensation of the artefacts induced by the patient physiological motions for diagnostic purpose through optical biopsies (3D micrometric resolution optical images). The obtained results seem promising in terms of low time processing and improvement of the quality of the reconstructed image compared to the traditional sparse acquisition.},

Lightsheet microscopy has emerged as the tool-of-choice for 3D characterization of rapidly evolving systems. However, to obtain a 3D image, either the sample or parts of the microscope are moved, limiting the acquisition speed. Here, we propose a novel inertia-free light-sheet-based scheme for volumetric imaging at high temporal resolution. Our approach comprises a novel combination of an acousto-optic scanner to produce tailored illumination and an acoustic-optofluidic lens, placed in the detection path to provide extended depth-of-field. Such a combination enables unsurpassed 3D imaging speeds up to 200 volumes per second. The volumetric imaging speed is limited only by the acquisition frame rate of the camera and the desired signal-to-noise ratio. Our volumetric microscope allows for invariant acquisition along the detection axis, avoiding extensive processing or complex deconvolution methods to restore image quality.},

Over the last decade, intraoperative OCT has evolved from two-dimensional imaging using handheld probes to include biopsy-needles for minimally invasive deep-tissue imaging, surgical instrumentation using optical feedback for tremor dampening and stabilization, and stereomicroscope integrated systems that provide real-time three- and four-dimensional visualization of surgical maneuvers. In addition, several preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of combining intraoperative OCT imaging with novel image-processing and display methods to implement augmented/virtual reality and robotic surgical guidance platforms. While research and commercialization of these innovations have been largely driven by needs in ophthalmology, OCT is finding new clinical applications in surgical oncology and neurosurgery. In this paper, we review recent developments in intraoperative OCT and discuss current trends and future directions of the technology.},

For the most part, image-processing algorithms blur the edges of the estimated images, however TV regularization preserves the edges with no prior information on the observed and the original images. The regularization scalar parameter {$\lambda$} controls the amount of regularization allowed and it is an essential to obtain a high-quality regularized output. A wide-ranging review of several ways to put into practice TV regularization as well as its advantages and limitations are discussed.},

Weshow how any discrete wavelet transform or two band subbandfiltering withfinitefilters can be decomposed into afinite sequence of simplefiltering steps, which we call lifting steps but that are also known as ladder structures. This decomposition corresponds to afactorization of the polyphase matrix of the wavelet or subbandfilters into elementary matrices. That such a factorization is possible is well-known to algebraists (and expressed by the formula SL(n; R[Z, z-I]) = E(n; R[z, z-l])); it is also used in linear systems theory in the electrical engineering community. We present here a self-contained derivation, building the decomposition from basic principles such as the Euclidean algorithm, with a focus on applying it to waveletfiltering. This factorization provides an alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage that it can also be used in the biorthogonal, i.e., non-unitary case. Like the lattice factorization, the decomposition presented here asymptotically reduces the computational complexity of the transform by a factor two. It has other applications, such as the possibility of defining a wavelet-like transform that maps integers to integers.},

The SD-OCT image of biological tissue provides an intuitive and clear view for intraoperative diagnosis and monitoring in real time. The effect of laser ablation is analyzed using a quantitative mathematical model. The automatic endoscopic scanning platform combines an endoscopic probe and an SD-OCT sample arm to provide optical theranostic scanning motion. An optical fiber and a chargecoupled device camera are integrated into the endoscopic probe, allowing detection and coupling of the OCT-aiming beam and laser spots.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental assumptions of compressive sensing (CS) is that a signal can be reconstructed from a small number of samples by solving an optimization problem with the appropriate regularization term. Two standard regularization terms are the L1 norm and the total variation (TV) norm. We present a comparison of CS reconstruction results based on these two approaches in the context of chemical detection, and we demonstrate that optimization based on the L1 norm outperforms optimization based on the TV norm. Our comparison is driven by CS sampling, reconstruction, and chemical detection in two real-world datasets: the Physical Sciences Inc. Fabry-P\textasciiacute erot interferometer sensor multispectral dataset and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab FTIRbased longwave infrared sensor hyperspectral dataset. Both datasets contain the release of a chemical simulant such as glacial acetic acid, triethyl phosphate, and sulfur hexafluoride. For chemical detection we use the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) and bulk coherence, and we propose algorithmic ACE thresholds to define the presence or absence of a chemical of interest in both un-compressed data cubes and reconstructed data cubes. The un-compressed data cubes provide an approximate ground truth. We demonstrate that optimization based on either the L1 norm or TV norm results in successful chemical detection at a compression rate of 90\%, but we show that L1 optimization is preferable. We present quantitative comparisons of chemical detection on reconstructions from the two methods, with an emphasis on the number of pixels with an ACE value above the threshold.},

  abstract = {Scattered data approximation refers to the computation of a multi-dimensional function from measurements obtained from scattered spatial locations. For this problem, the class of methods that adopt a roughness minimization are the best performing ones. These methods are called variational methods and they are capable of handling contrasting levels of sample density. These methods express the required solution as a continuous model containing a weighted sum of thin-plate spline or radial basis functions with centres aligned to the measurement locations, and the weights are specified by a linear system of equations. The main hurdle in this type of method is that the linear system is ill-conditioned. Further, getting the weights that are parameters of the continuous model representing the solution is only a part of the effort. Getting a regular grid image requires resampling of the continuous model, which is typically expensive. We develop a computationally efficient and numerically stable method based on roughness minimization. The method leads to an algorithm that uses standard regular grid array operations only, which makes it attractive for parallelization. We demonstrate experimentally that we get these computational advantages only with a little compromise in performance when compared with thin-plate spline methods.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of reconstructing 2D images from randomly under-sampled confocal microscopy samples. The well known and widely celebrated total variation regularization, which is the 1 norm of derivatives, turns out to be unsuitable for this problem; it is unable to handle both noise and under-sampling together. This issue is linked with the notion of phase transition phenomenon observed in compressive sensing research, which is essentially the break-down of total variation methods, when sampling density gets lower than certain threshold. The severity of this breakdown is determined by the so-called mutual incoherence between the derivative operators and measurement operator. In our problem, the mutual incoherence is low, and hence the total variation regularization gives serious artifacts in the presence of noise even when the sampling density is not very low. There has been very few attempts in developing regularization methods that perform better than total variation regularization for this problem. We develop a multi-resolution based regularization method that is adaptive to image structure. In our approach, the desired reconstruction is formulated as a series of coarse-to-fine multi-resolution reconstructions; for reconstruction at each level, the regularization is constructed to be adaptive to the image structure, where the information for adaption is obtained from the reconstruction obtained at coarser resolution level. This adaptation is achieved by using maximum entropy principle, where the required adaptive regularization is determined as the maximizer of entropy subject to the information extracted from the coarse reconstruction as constraints. We also utilize the directionally adaptive second order derivatives for constructing the regularization with directions guided by the given coarse reconstruction, which leads to an improved suppression of artifacts. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed regularization method over existing ones using several reconstruction examples.},

The goal of this study was to observe the effects of vocal fold collagen content on optical coherence tomography imaging to develop a quantifiable marker of disease. Study Design. Excised specimen study. Setting. Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Subjects and Methods. Porcine vocal folds were injected with collagenase to remove collagen from the lamina propria. Optical coherence tomography imaging was performed preinjection and at 0, 45, 90, and 180 minutes postinjection. Mean pixel intensity (or image brightness) was extracted from images of collagenase- and control-treated hemilarynges. Texture analysis of the lamina propria at each injection site was performed to extract image contrast. Twofactor repeated measure analysis of variance and t tests were used to determine statistical significance. Picrosirius red staining was performed to confirm collagenase activity. Results. Mean pixel intensity was higher at injection sites of collagenase-treated vocal folds than control vocal folds (P \textbackslash{} .0001). Fold change in image contrast was significantly increased in collagenase-treated vocal folds than control vocal folds (P = .002). Picrosirius red staining in control specimens revealed collagen fibrils most prominent in the subepithelium and above the thyroarytenoid muscle. Specimens treated with collagenase exhibited a loss of these structures. Conclusion. Collagen removal from vocal fold tissue increases image brightness of underlying structures. This inverse relationship may be useful in treating vocal fold scarring in patients.},

The goal of this study was to develop a methodology using OCT to identify quantifiable markers of vocal fold development. Study Design: In vivo study. Methods: A two-step process was developed to reproducibly image the midmembranous vocal fold edge of 10 patients younger than 2 years and 10 patients between 11 and 16 years of age using OCT. An image analysis algorithm was implemented to extract OCT-derived A-lines for each patient. These A-lines were divided into three zones according to apparent changes in slope. Relative attenuation coefficients, or tissue- and system-dependent parameters that describe the rate at which optical signal decays, were calculated for each zone. Results: Young patients had distinct relative attenuation coefficients in zone 1 (P {$<$} .0001), whereas zones 2 and 3 were indistinct (P 5 .1129). Older patients had distinct relative attenuation coefficients in zones 1, 2, and 3 (P {$<$} .0370). Between age groups, relative attenuation coefficients were different in zones 2 and 3 (P {$<$} .0001, P 5 .0315, respectively) and indistinct in zone 1 (P 5 .1438). Conclusions: Relative attenuation coefficients can be used as markers of vocal fold development. Differences in relative attenuation coefficients likely represent changes in extracellular matrix structure within the lamina propria and may become useful for guiding treatment of voice disorders in the pediatric population.},

  pages = {139},
  abstract = {Today, lasers are used in many surgical procedures due to their ability of performing precise incisions, and ablations. With the development of fiber-coupled lasers, even minimally invasive procedures started making use of laser tools. However, existing fiber tools do not provide the same performance as traditional laser systems, often causing significantly more tissue carbonization. This can be attributed to the lack of optics in fiber tools, which requires the tip of the fiber to be placed in direct contact with the tissue, increasing the collateral damage of the laser. To avoid this issue, a compact focusing system should be integrated in the fiber tool. However, traditional optical systems based on moving lenses are too large and bulky for that. To solve this problem, this thesis proposes a focusing system based on MEMS deformable mirrors. Using microfabrication methods, we develop a novel MEMS varifocal mirror, designed for focusing high-power laser in a fiber laser system. The design of this mirror is based on state-of-the-art MEMS deformable mirrors, which have been proposed for microscopy applications, with significant adaptations for high-power lasers, including different actuation mechanisms and control strategies. We explore the use of hydraulic actuation to achieve large focal length range, while providing compatibility with high-power laser. The deflection of the mirror is controlled using a feed-forward model, in which parameters are obtained through characterization of the fabrication process. This allows controlling the mirror without a beam splitter or external sensors, which contributes to the miniaturization of the focusing system.},

  abstract = {A novel piezoelectric scanning mirror design for endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) is presented. OCT is an interferometric technique providing microscopic tomographic sectioning of biological samples with mm-range penetration capability in tissue and is suited for integration with endoscopes using fiber-based light delivery to the sample. The piezoelectric scanning mirror was designed to provide wide-range rapid forwarding-looking scanning of the optical beam at the distal end of a compact catheter. The optical scanner provides a large ratio of mirror aperture to device size with rectangular mirror sizes ranging from 600 {$\mu$}m \texttimes{} 840 {$\mu$}m to 840 {$\mu$}m \texttimes{} 1600 {$\mu$}m. Static angular displacements up to {$\pm$}7{$\smwhtcircle$} (mechanical angle) were demonstrated and resonance frequencies of hundreds of Hz (and up to 1\textendash 2 kHz) were measured, depending on the mirror size. The imaging capability of the piezoelectric scanner was demonstrated using a bench-top spectrometer-based Fourier-domain OCT system.},

However, its underlying mathematical concepts have not been studied so far. The goal of our paper is to provide this missing theoretical foundation. We study the continuous limit of the inherently discrete census transform and embed it into a variational setting. Our analysis shows two surprising results: The census-based technique enforces matchings of extrema, and it induces an anisotropy in the data term by acting along level lines. Last but not least, we establish links to the widely-used gradient constancy assumption and present experiments that confirm our findings.},

  abstract = {The trade-off between throughput and image quality is an inherent challenge in microscopy. To improve throughput, compressive imaging under-samples image signals; the images are then computationally reconstructed by solving a regularized inverse problem. Compared to traditional regularizers, Deep Learning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image quality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the compression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising the reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose differentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ({$\partial$}\textmu ) which includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnablephysical parameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse model. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal compressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we performed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope configurations. Our results suggest that learned sampling outperforms widely used traditional compressive sampling schemes at higher compressions (\texttimes 100 - 1000) in terms of reconstruction quality. We further utilize our framework for Task Aware Compression. The experimental results show superior performance on segmentation tasks even at extremely high compression (\texttimes 4096).},

  abstract = {Objectives\textemdash Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the US largely due to late detection secondary to unreliable symptomology and screening tools without adequate resolution. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recently emerging imaging modality with promise in ovarian cancer diagnostics, providing non-destructive subsurface imaging at imaging depths up to 2 mm with near-histological grade resolution (10\textendash 20 {$\mu$}m). In this study, we developed the first ever laparoscopic OCT (LOCT) device, evaluated the safety and feasibility of LOCT, and characterized the microstructural features of human ovaries in vivo. Methods\textemdash A custom LOCT device was fabricated specifically for laparoscopic imaging of the ovaries in patients undergoing oophorectomy. OCT images were compared with histopathology to identify preliminary architectural imaging features of normal and pathologic ovarian tissue. Results\textemdash Thirty ovaries in 17 primarily peri or post-menopausal women were successfully imaged with LOCT: 16 normal, 5 endometriosis, 3 serous cystadenoma, and 4 adenocarcinoma. Preliminary imaging features developed for each category reveal qualitative differences in the homogeneous character of normal post-menopausal ovary, the ability to image small subsurface inclusion cysts, and distinguishable features for endometriosis, cystadenoma, and adenocarcinoma. Conclusions\textemdash We present the development and successful implementation of the first laparoscopic OCT probe. Comparison of OCT images and corresponding histopathology allowed for the description of preliminary microstructural features for normal ovary, endometriosis, and benign and malignant surface epithelial neoplasms. These results support the potential of OCT both as a diagnostic tool and imaging modality for further evaluation of ovarian cancer pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Raman imaging is a promising technique that allows the spatial distribution of different components in the sample to be obtained using the molecular fingerprint information on individual species. However, the imaging speed is the bottleneck for the current Raman imaging methods to monitor the dynamic process of living cells. In this paper, we developed an artificial intelligence assisted fast Raman imaging method over the already fast line scan Raman imaging method. The reduced imaging time is realized by widening the slit and laser beam, and scanning the sample with a large scan step. The imaging quality is improved by a data-driven approach to train a deep convolutional neural network, which statistically learns to transform low-resolution images acquired at a high speed into high-resolution ones that previously were only possible with a low imaging speed. Accompanied with the improvement of the image resolution, the deteriorated spectral resolution as a consequence of a wide slit is also restored, thereby the fidelity of the spectral information is retained. The imaging time can be reduced to within 1 min, which is about five times faster than the state-of-the-art line scan Raman imaging techniques without sacrificing spectral and spatial resolution. We then demonstrated the reliability of the current method using fixed cells. We finally used the method to monitor the dynamic evolution process of living cells. Such an imaging speed opens a door to the label-free observation of cellular events with conventional Raman microscopy.},

BACKGROUND The incidence and detailed morphologic characteristics of PR, PE, and CN in STEMI patients and their outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are unknown. METHODS A total of 112 STEMI patients who underwent PCI within 12 h from symptom onset were included. Both optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound were performed following aspiration thrombectomy. RESULTS The incidence of PR, PE, and CN was 64.3\%, 26.8\%, and 8.0\%, respectively. PE and CN, compared with PR, had more fibrous plaque (p {$<$} 0.001 and p {$<$} 0.001) and less thin-cap fibroatheroma (p {$<$} 0.001 and p {$<$} 0.001) as well as smaller plaque burden (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.003 and p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001) and remodeling index (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.003 and p {$<$} 0.001). PE had greater plaque eccentricity index than PR and CN (p {$<$} 0.001 and p {$<$} 0.001). CN had greater calcified arc and shallower calcium than PR (p {$<$} 0.001 and p {$<$} 0.001) or PE (p {$<$} 0.001 and p {$<$} 0.001). More than one-half of CN had negative remodeling. PE had a lower incidence of no-reflow phenomenon after PCI than PR (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.011). CONCLUSIONS PE was the underlying mechanism in one-fourth of STEMI. PE was characterized by eccentric fibrous plaque. CN was characterized by superficial large calcium and negative remodeling. PE was associated with less microvascular damage after PCI.

This allowed 98 yeast cells to be imaged in a time a traditional system could only measure 20.           ,              Raman hyperspectral imaging is a powerful method to obtain detailed chemical information about a wide variety of organic and inorganic samples noninvasively and without labels. However, due to the weak, nonresonant nature of spontaneous Raman scattering, acquiring a Raman imaging dataset is time-consuming and inefficient. In this paper we utilize a compressive imaging strategy coupled with a context-aware image prior to improve Raman imaging speed by 5- to 10-fold compared to classic point-scanning Raman imaging, while maintaining the traditional benefits of point scanning imaging, such as isotropic resolution and confocality. With faster data acquisition, large datasets can be acquired in reasonable timescales, leading to more reliable downstream analysis. On standard samples, context-aware Raman compressive imaging (CARCI) was able to reduce the number of measurements by {$\sim$}85\% while maintaining high image quality (SSIM {$>$}0.85). Using CARCI, we obtained a large dataset of chemical images of fission yeast cells, showing that by collecting 5-fold more cells in a given experiment time, we were able to get more accurate chemical images, identification of rare cells, and improved biochemical modeling. For example, applying VCA to nearly 100 cells' data together, cellular organelles were resolved that were not faithfully reconstructed by a single cell's dataset.},

A new method was explored to conveniently tune the scanning frequency of a resonant fiber-optic scanner, by properly selecting the fiber-optic cantilever length, partially changing the mechanical property of the cantilever, and adding a weight to the cantilever tip. Systematic analyses indicated the resonant scanning frequency can be tuned over two orders of magnitude spanning from \textasciitilde 10Hz to \textasciitilde kHz. Such a flexible scanning frequency range makes it possible to set an appropriate scanning speed of the endoscope to match the different Ascan rates of a variety of FD-OCT systems.

This study aims to validate that optical coherence tomography (OCT), a minimally invasive imaging technique with high resolution (\textasciitilde 10 {$\mu$}m), is able to visualize and monitor acute radiationinduced esophageal damage (ARIED) in mice. We compare our findings with histopathology as the gold standard. Irradiated mice receive a single dose of 40 Gy at proximal and distal spots of the esophagus of 10.0 mm in diameter. We scan mice using OCT at two, three, and seven days post-irradiation. In OCT analysis, we define ARIED as a presence of distorted esophageal layering, change in backscattering signal properties, or change in the esophageal wall thickness. The average esophageal wall thickness is 0.53 mm larger on OCT when ARIED is present based on histopathology. The overall sensitivity and specificity of OCT to detect ARIED compared to histopathology are 94\% and 47\%, respectively. However, the overall sensitivity of OCT to assess ARIED is 100\% seven days post-irradiation. We validate the capability of OCT to detect ARIED induced by high doses in mice. Nevertheless, clinical studies are required to assess the potential role of OCT to visualize ARIED in humans.},

  abstract = {Real-time depth metrology during material removal via laser ablation is useful in many forms of laser machining. Until now, coaxial optical coherence tomography (OCT) metrology was achieved by the coupling of an OCT imaging beam and ablating beams using a dichroic filter. We present an alternative design with all fiber delivery that is more suitable for surgical laser ablation applications. The novel system design integrates a high peak-power pulsed Yb-doped fiber laser (1064nm) coupled directly into the sample arm of a swept-source OCT system ({$\lambda$}c = 1310nm). We measured the OCT signal degradation due to dispersion and attenuation through the ablation fiber laser cavity. Ablation progression is measured in real-time using M-mode OCT. The mean depth targeting error was found to range from 10\textmu m to 80\textmu m in phantom ablation experiments and 21\textmu m to 60\textmu m in bone ablation. A number of issues have been solved, including point-spread function (PSF) peak broadening due to signal delay and dispersion, high bending loss due to dissimilar fiber used throughout the design, and problems due to the extremely high ablation power to swept-source power ratio ({$>$} 2x104 peak to average power). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of thermal-mediated laser ablation drilling integrated with coaxial OCT imaging through a single-mode, single-cladded output fiber, without using dichroic beam splitters or free-space optic filters anywhere in the optical path and with this high ablation laser power to OCT source power ratio. The removal of bulk optics compared to existing designs opens a new path for compact integration of the entire system. Also, since the ablation laser and OCT feedback system exist along the same fiber path, the need for maintenance and repair are greatly reduced since spatial beam alignment and the potential open-air contamination of optical surfaces are virtually eliminated. We believe that this integrated system is a great candidate for adoption in depth-controlled surgical ablation applications.},

Beyond guidance of stent selection and optimization of deployment, invasive imaging facilitates angiographic interpretation and may guide treatment in acute coronary syndrome. Intravascular imaging can provide additional important diagnostic information when confronted with angiographically ambiguous lesions and allows assessment of plaque morphology enabling identification of vulnerability characteristics. This second document focuses on useful imaging features to identify culprit and vulnerable coronary plaque, which offers the interventional cardiologist guidance on when to adopt an intracoronary imaging-guided approach to the treatment of coronary artery disease and provides an appraisal of intravascular imaging-derived metrics to define the haemodynamic significance of coronary lesions.},

Due in part to the simplicity and robustness of its design, Fourier domain CP-OCT (FD-CP-OCT) offers advantages in many endoscopic sensing and imaging applications. FD-CP-OCT uses simple, interchangeable fiber optic probes that are easily integrated into small and delicate surgical tools. The system is capable of providing not only high-resolution imaging but also optical sensing. Here, we report progress towards practical application of FD-CP-OCT in the setting of delicate microsurgical procedures such as intraocular retinal surgery. To meet the challenges presented by the microsurgical requirements of these procedures, we have developed and initiated the validation of applicable fiber optic probes. By integrating these probes into our developing imaging system, we have obtained high-resolution OCT images and have also completed a demonstration of their potential sensing capabilities. Specifically, we utilize multiple superluminescent diodes to demonstrate sub-3-\textmu m axial resolution in water; we propose a technique to quantitatively evaluate the spatial distribution of oxygen saturation levels in tissue; and we present evidence supportive of the technology's surface sensing and tool guidance potential by demonstrating topological and motion compensation capabilities.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Surgical oncology can benefit from specialized tools that enhance imaging and enable precise cutting and removal of tissue without damage to adjacent structures. The combination of highresolution, fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) coaligned with a nanosecond pulsed thulium (Tm) laser offers advantages over conventional surgical laser systems. Tm lasers provide superior beam quality, high volumetric tissue removal rates with minimal residual thermal footprint in tissue, enabling a reduction in unwanted damage to delicate adjacent sub-surface structures such as nerves or microvessels. We investigated such a combined Tm/OCT system with co-aligned imaging and cutting beams\textemdash a configuration we call a ``smart laser knife.'' Methods: A blow-off model that considers absorption coefficients and beam delivery systems was utilized to predict Tm cut depth, tissue removal rate and spatial distribution of residual thermal injury. Experiments were performed to verify the volumetric removal rate predicted by the model as a function of average power. A bench-top, combined Tm/OCT system was constructed using a 15W 1940 nm nanosecond pulsed Tm fiber laser (500 mJ pulse energy, 100 ns pulse duration, 30 kHz repetition rate) for removing tissue and a swept source laser (1310 \AE{} 70 nm, 100 kHz sweep rate) for OCT imaging. Tissue phantoms were used to demonstrate precise surgery with blood vessel avoidance. Depth imaging informed cutting/removal of targeted tissue structures by the Tm laser was performed. Results: Laser cutting was accomplished around and above phantom blood vessels while avoiding damage to vessel walls. A tissue removal rate of 5.5 mm3/sec was achieved experimentally, in comparison to the model prediction of approximately 6 mm3/sec. Conclusion: We describe a system that combines OCT and laser tissue modification with a Tm laser. Simulation results of the tissue removal rate using a simple model, as a function of average power, are in good agreement with experimental results using tissue phantoms. Lasers Surg.

The prior OCT images were used to compute three-dimensional tumor margin and angiography images, which guided the coagulation and ablation steps. Histology of the treated regions was then compared to post-treatment OCT images. Results: Tumor sizing based on OCT margin detection matched histology to within experimental error. Although fluorescence microscopy imaging showed the tumors were collocated with OCT imaging, margin assessment using confocal microscopy failed to see the extent of the tumor beyond \textasciitilde{} 250 \textmu m in depth, as verified by OCT and histology. The two-laser approach to surgery utilizing Tm wavelength for coagulation and Er:YAG for ablation yielded bloodless resection of tumor regions with minimal residual damage as seen in histology. Conclusion: Precise and bloodless tumor resection under OCT image guidance is demonstrated in the murine xenograft brain cancer model. Tumor margins and vasculature are accurately made visible without need for exogenous contrast agents.},

The overarching goal of this work has been to image smaller previously inaccessible luminal organs in real time, at high resolution, in a minimally invasive manner that does not compromise the comfort of the subject, nor introduce additional risk. Thus, an initial diagnosis can be made, or a small precancerous lesion may be detected, in a small-diameter luminal organ that would not have otherwise been possible. Continuous advancement in the field has enabled a wide range of optical scanners. Different scanning techniques, working principles, and the applications of endoscopic scanners are summarized in this review.},

Technical advances in the micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) and optical fields have enabled the further miniaturization of endoscopes, resulting in the ability to image previously inaccessible small-caliber luminal organs, enabling the early detection of lesions and other abnormalities in these tissues. The development of scanning fiber endoscopes supports the fabrication of small cantileverbased imaging devices without compromising the image resolution. The size of an endoscope is highly dependent on the actuation and scanning method used to illuminate the target image area. Different actuation methods used in the design of small-sized cantilever-based endoscopes are reviewed in this paper along with their working principles, advantages and disadvantages, generated scanning patterns, and applications.},

In-vivo 3D endoscopic imaging was performed by using a recently developed 2-axis MEMS scanning catheter and a spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT), running at 18.5 frames/s. Imaging was performed in the operating room with patients under general anesthesia and 3D images were acquired either by 2D scanning of the scanner on the sites of interest or by combining 1D scanning and manual sliding to capture whole length of the vocal fold. Vocal fold scar, polyps, nodules, papilloma and malignant lesions were imaged and characteristics of individual lesions were analyzed in terms of spatial distribution and variation of tissue structure and birefringence. The 3D large sectional PSOCT imaging showed that the spatial extent of vocal fold lesions can be found non-invasively with good contrast from normal tissue.},

In this study, we built a flexible endoscopic \textmu OCT probe with an outer diameter of 1.2\,mm, which acquires three-dimensional images of the arterial microstructures via helical scanning with an axial and lateral resolutions of 1.83\,\textmu m and 3.38\,\textmu m in air, respectively. Furthermore, the depth of focus of the \textmu OCT imaging probe was extended two-fold using a binary phase spatial filter. We demonstrated that the present endoscopic \textmu OCT could image cellular level features of a rabbit artery with high-risk atheroma and a bioresorbable scaffold-implanted swine coronary artery. This highly-translatable endoscopic \textmu OCT will be a useful tool for investigating coronary artery disease and stent biology.},

Previous studies in other tissues have shown an axial resolution of less than 10 urn and a maximum imaging depth of about 2 mm. The objectives of this pilot study were to obtain images from the vocal folds of subjects who were being evaluated and/or treated for vocal fold disease and to evaluate how well normal and pathologic microstructure could be seen in these images. Methods: Twenty-six vocal folds in 13 subjects were imaged with a flexible OCT probe. The images were successfully collected from subjects who were either topically anesthetized or under general anesthesia for microlaryngoscopic procedures. Results: The thickness of the epithelium, the relative collagen content of the subepithelial connective tissue, and certain characteristic features of lesions (including cysts, scarring, and papilloma) were seen in the OCT and PS-OCT images. Conclusions: "Live microscopy" of the human vocal folds is very promising for improved diagnosis, mapping, and treatment planning. To our knowledge, this study is the first application of PS-OCT for in vivo imaging of the human vocal folds.},

We explored physiologically triggered Fourier-domain OCT for imaging vocal folds during phonation. The goal is to visualize dynamic histological cross sections and four-dimensional data sets where multiple planes are displayed in synchronized motion. If feasible, this approach could be a useful research tool and spur development of new clinical instrumentation. Study Design\textemdash A Fourier-domain, triggered OCT system was created and tested in experiments on excised calf larynges to obtain preliminary observations and characterize important factors affecting image quality. Methods\textemdash Larynges were imaged during phonation driven by warm, humidified air. A subglottal pressure signal was used to synchronize the OCT system with the phonatory cycle. Image sequences were recorded as functions of anatomical location or sub-glottal pressure. Implant materials were also imaged during vibration, both in isolation and after injection into a vocal fold. Results\textemdash Oscillations of epithelium and lamina propria were observed, and parameters such as shape, amplitude, and velocity of the vocal fold mucosal waves were found to be measurable. Ripples of mucosal wave as small as 100 {$\mu$}m in vertical height were clearly visible. Internal strain was also observed in normal and implanted vocal folds. Conclusions\textemdash Four-dimensional OCT of the vocal fold may help to more directly relate biomechanics to anatomy and disease. It may also be useful for assaying the functional rheology of implants in the context of real tissue. With further development, this technology has potential for clinical endoscopic application.},

English language human observational studies and clinical trials published in PubMed and Embase were included if they assessed any of the following: (i) in-vivo features and accuracy of OCT at diagnosing esophageal IM, sub-squamous intestinal metaplasia (SSIM), dysplasia, or cancer, and (ii) accuracy of OCT in staging esophageal cancer.

In the two prospective studies that assessed accuracy of OCT at identifying IM, sensitivity was 81\%\textendash 97\%, and specificity was 57\%\textendash 92\%. In the two prospective studies that assessed accuracy of OCT at identifying dysplasia and early cancer, sensitivity was 68\%\textendash 83\%, and specificity was 75\%\textendash 82\%. Observational studies described significant variability in the ability of OCT to accurately identify SSIM. Two prospective studies that compared the accuracy of OCT at staging early squamous cell carcinoma to histologic resection specimens reported accuracy of {$>$}90\%. Risk of bias and applicability concerns was rated as low among the prospective studies using the QUADAS-2 questionnaire. OCT may identify intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, but its accuracy may not meet recommended thresholds to replace 4-quadrant biopsies in clinical practice.

Yet, its application for large and high-resolution imaging remains challenging in terms of the computation and acquisition effort involved. Often, low-resolution imaging is sufficient for most of the considered tasks and only a fraction of cases demand high resolution, but the problem is that the user does not know in advance when high-resolution acquisition is required. To address this, we propose a multiscale progressive CS method for the high-resolution imaging. The progressive sampling refines the resolution of the image, while incorporating the already sampled low-resolution information, making the process highly efficient. Moreover, the multiscale property of the progressively sensed samples is capitalized for a fast, deep learning (DL) reconstruction, otherwise infeasible due to practical limitations of training on high-resolution images. The progressive CS and the multiscale reconstruction method are analyzed numerically and demonstrated experimentally with a single pixel camera imaging system. We demonstrate 4-megapixel size progressive compressive imaging with about half the overall number of samples, more than an order of magnitude faster reconstruction, and improved reconstruction quality compared to alternative conventional CS approaches.},

Indeed, after it was recognized that traditional multiscale methods are not very efficient at capturing edges and other anisotropic features which frequently dominate multidimensional phenomena, several methods were introduced to overcome their limitations. The shearlet representation stands out since it offers a unique combinations of some highly desirable properties: it has a single or finite set of generating functions, it provides optimally sparse representations for a large class of multidimensional data, it is possible to use compactly supported analyzing functions, it has fast algorithmic implementations and it allows a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realms. In this chapter, we present a self-contained overview of the main results concerning the theory and applications of shearlets.},

A non-rigid image registration algorithm is used to suppress motion artifacts from non-uniform rotational distortion (NURD), cardiac motion or respiration. En face OCT images at various depths can be generated.

  abstract = {Background and Objective During tissue ablation, laser light can be delivered with high precision in the transverse dimensions but final incision depth can be difficult to control. We monitor incision depth as it progresses, providing feedback to ensure that material removal occurs within a localized target volume, reducing the possibility of undesirable damage to tissues below the incision. Materials and Methods Ex vivo cortical and cancellous bone was ablated using pulsed lasers with center wavelengths of 1,064 and 1,070 nm, while being imaged in real-time using inline coherent imaging (ICI) at rates of up to 300 kHz and axial resolution of {$\sim$}6 \textmu m. With real-time feedback, laser exposure was terminated before perforating into natural inclusions of the cancellous bone and verified by brightfield microscopy of the crater cross-sections accessed via side-polishing. Results ICI provides direct information about incision penetration even in the presence of intense backscatter from the pulsed laser and plasma emissions. In this study, ICI is able to anticipate structures 176 {$\pm$} 8 \textmu m below the ablation front with signal intensity 9 {$\pm$} 2 dB above the noise floor. As a result, the operator is able to terminate exposure of the laser sparing a 50 \textmu m thick layer of bone between the bottom of the incision to a natural inclusion in the cancellous bone. Versatility of the ICI system was demonstrated over a wide range of light\textendash tissue interactions from thermal regime to direct solid-plasma transition. Conclusions ICI can be used as non-contact real-time feedback to monitor the depth of an incision created by laser ablation, especially in heterogeneous tissue where ablation rate is less predictable. Furthermore, ICI can image below the ablation front making it possible to stop laser exposure to limit unintentional damage to subsurface structures such as blood vessels or nervous tissue.

Our method is a major improvement and generalization of the multi-scale sparsity based tomographic denoising (MSBTD) algorithm we recently introduced for reducing speckle noise. Our new technique exhibits several advantages over MSBTD, including its capability to simultaneously reduce noise and interpolate missing data. Unlike MSBTD, our new method does not require an a priori high-quality image from the target imaging subject and thus offers the potential to shorten clinical imaging sessions. This novel image restoration method, which we termed sparsity based simultaneous denoising and interpolation (SBSDI), utilizes sparse representation dictionaries constructed from previously collected datasets. We tested the SBSDI algorithm on retinal spectral domain optical coherence tomography images captured in the clinic. Experiments showed that the SBSDI algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

This study investigated whether a miniature B-scan forward-imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe can be combined with the laser to provide real-time visual feedback during laser incisions. Study Design/Methods and Materials: A miniature 25gauge B-scan forward-imaging OCT probe was developed and combined with a 250 mm hollow-glass waveguide to permit delivery of 6.1 mm laser energy. A gelatin mixture and both porcine corneal and retinal tissues were simultaneously imaged and lased (6.1 mm, 10 Hz, 0.4\textendash 0.7 mJ) through air. The ablation studies were observed and recorded in real time. The crater dimensions were measured using OCT imaging software (Bioptigen, Durham, NC). Histological analysis was performed on the ocular tissues. Results: The combined miniature forward-imaging OCT and mid-infrared laser-delivery probe successfully imaged real-time tissue ablation in gelatin, corneal tissue, and retinal tissue. Application of a constant number of 60 pulses at 0.5 mJ/pulse to the gelatin resulted in a mean crater depth of 123 \AE{} 15 mm. For the corneal tissue, there was a significant correlation between the number of pulses used and depth of the lased hole (Pearson correlation coefficient {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.82; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0002). Histological analysis of the cornea and retina tissues showed discrete holes with minimal thermal damage. Conclusions: A combined miniature OCT and laserdelivery probe can monitor real-time tissue laser ablation. With additional testing and improvements, this novel instrument has the future possibility of effectively guiding surgeries by simultaneously imaging and ablating tissue. Lasers Surg.

Therefore, a forward-looking single ber scanning optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe with a local observation function has been developed to achieve precise sampling. The new OCT probe is only 1 mm in diameter. The probe is composed of a patterned electroplated copper coil fabricated on a polyimide tube using non-planar photofabrication technique, and an optical ber having a permanent magnetic tube with a diameter of 0.5 mm. When an electrical alternating current is supplied to the coil, the permanent magnet vibrates electromagnetically with the optical ber. To increase the ber vibration amplitude, a micro gradient-index (GRIN) lens is set in front of the tip of the optical ber. Using the micro GRIN lens, the output beam is focused, and the scanning range is enlarged. The view angle becomes approximately 45 , and image resolution becomes approximately 60 {$\mu$}m. The structure of grating was successfully imaged using the new OCT probe. Further improvements and animal experiments are necessary to determine the clinical application of the probe.},

  abstract = {Endoscopic imaging is the main method for detecting gastrointestinal diseases, which adversely affect human health. White light endoscopy (WLE) was the first method used for endoscopic examination and is still the preliminary step in the detection of gastrointestinal diseases during clinical examination. However, it cannot accurately diagnose gastrointestinal diseases owing to its poor correlation with histopathological diagnosis. In recent years, many advanced endoscopic methods have emerged to improve the detection accuracy by endoscopy. Chromoendoscopy (CE) enhances the contrast between normal and diseased tissues using biocompatible dye agents. Narrow band imaging (NBI) can improve the contrast between capillaries and submucosal vessels by changing the light source acting on the tissue using special filters to realize the visualization of the vascular structure. Flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE) technique uses the reflectance spectrum estimation technique to obtain individual spectral images and reconstructs an enhanced image of the mucosal surface using three selected spectral images. The i-Scan technology takes advantage of the different reflective properties of normal and diseased tissues to obtain images, and enhances image contrast through post-processing algorithms. These abovementioned methods can be used to detect gastrointestinal diseases by observing the macroscopic structure of the digestive tract mucosa, but the ability of early cancer detection is limited with low resolution. However, based on the principle of confocal imaging, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) can enable cellular visualization with high-performance probes, which can present cellular morphology that is highly consistent with that shown by biopsy to provide the possibility of early detection of cancer. Other endoscopic imaging techniques including endoscopic optical coherence tomography (EOCT) and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE), are also promising for diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases. This review focuses on these technologies and aims to provide an overview of different technologies and their clinical applicability.},

Contemporary imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence, have been investigated to visualize microvasculature and morphological changes for detecting early stage CRC in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In our study, we developed a multimodal endoscopic system with simultaneous co-registered OCT and NIR fluorescence imaging. By introducing a contrast agent into the vascular network, NIR fluorescence is able to highlight the cancer-suspected area based on significant change of tumor vascular density and morphology caused by angiogenesis. With the addition of co-registered OCT images to reveal subsurface tissue layer architecture, the suspected regions can be further investigated by the altered light scattering resulting from the morphological abnormality. Using this multimodal imaging system, an in vivo animal study was performed using a F344-ApcPircUwm rat, in which the layered architecture and microvasculature of the colorectal wall at different time points were demonstrated. The co-registered OCT and NIR fluorescence images allowed the identification and differentiation of normal colon, hyperplastic polyp, adenomatous polyp, and adenocarcinoma. This multimodal imaging strategy using a single imaging probe has demonstrated the enhanced capability of identification and classification of CRC compared to using any of these technologies alone, thus has the potential to provide a new clinical tool to advance gastroenterology practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Preclinical and clinical diagnostics increasingly rely on techniques to visualize internal organs at high resolution via endoscopes. Miniaturized endoscopic probes are necessary for imaging small luminal or delicate organs without causing trauma to tissue. However, current fabrication methods limit the imaging performance of highly miniaturized probes, restricting their widespread application. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel ultrathin probe fabrication technique that utilizes 3D microprinting to reliably create side-facing freeform micro-optics ({$<$}130\,\textmu m diameter) on single-mode fibers. Using this technique, we built a fully functional ultrathin aberration-corrected optical coherence tomography probe. This is the smallest freeform 3D imaging probe yet reported, with a diameter of 0.457\,mm, including the catheter sheath. We demonstrated image quality and mechanical flexibility by imaging atherosclerotic human and mouse arteries. The ability to provide microstructural information with the smallest optical coherence tomography catheter opens a gateway for novel minimally invasive applications in disease.},

To advance clinical adoption of this imaging technique, it will be important to validate TCE images with co-localized histology, the current diagnostic gold standard. One method for co-localizing OCT images with histology is image-targeted laser marking, which has previously been implemented using a driveshaft-based, balloon OCT catheter, deployed during endoscopy. In this paper, we present a TCE device that scans and targets the imaging beam using a low-cost stepper motor that is integrated inside the capsule. In combination with a 4-laser-diode, high power 1430/1450 nm marking laser system (800 mW on the sample and 1s pulse duration), this technology generated clearly visible marks, with a spatial targeting accuracy of better than 0.5 mm. A laser safety study was done on swine esophagus ex vivo, showing that these exposure parameters did not alter the submucosa, with a large, 4-5x safety margin. The technology was demonstrated in living human subjects and shown to be effective for co-localizing OCT TCE images to biopsies obtained during subsequent endoscopy.},

Tethered capsule optical coherence tomography (OCT) can volumetrically image oesophageal mucosa in unsedated patients and detect features of BE. We investigated ultrahigh-s\- peed tethered capsule swept-s\- ource OCT (SS-O\- CT), improved device design, developed procedural techniques and measured capsule contact, longitudinal pullback non-u\- niformity and patient toleration. Design\hspace{0.6em} OCT was performed in 16 patients prior to endoscopic surveillance/treatment. Unsedated patients swallowed the capsule with sips of water and the tether was pulled back to image the oesophagus. SS-\-OCT at 1\,000\,000 A-\-scans/s enabled imaging 10\,cm oesophageal lengths in 10\,s with 30\,\textmu m transverse and 8\,\textmu m axial resolution. Capsule contact, longitudinal image coverage and patient toleration were assessed. Results\hspace{0.6em} Nine patients had non-\-dysplastic BE, three had ablative treatment-\-na\"ive neoplasia and four had prior ablation for dysplasia. Dry swallows facilitated capsule transit through the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES), and waiting 10\,s before pullback reduced swallow induced LES relaxation. Slow nasal inhalation facilitated capsule retrieval and minimised gag reflex. The procedure was well tolerated. Ultrahigh-\-speed SS-\-OCT generated cross-\- sectional and subsurface en face images showing BE features, while subsurface en face images were required to assess the gastro-\-oesophageal junction. Candidate features of dysplasia were also identified which could inform follow-\-up endoscopy/biopsy. BE features were seen in all patients with histologically confirmed BE. Mean capsule contact over BE was 75\%{$\pm$}27\% for all patients and better in short segment BE. Mean longitudinal image coverage over BE was 59\%{$\pm$}34\% and better for long segment BE. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Ultrahigh-s\- peed tethered capsule SS-\-OCT can image en face and cross-\-sectional mucosal features over wide areas. Device and procedure optimisation improved performance. BE features could be identified in all patients, but limited capsule contact and longitudinal coverage could cause sampling errors for focal pathologies.},

We establish convergence for this algorithm, and apply it to solving problems in image reconstruction with total variation regularization.

Despite great advances in instrumentation, the acquisition speed for a spectroscopic SRS image stack is fundamentally bounded by the pixel integration time. In this work, we report three-dimensional sparsely sampled spectroscopic SRS imaging that measures \textasciitilde 20\% of pixels throughout the stack. In conjunction with related work in low-rank matrix completion (e.g., the Netflix Prize), we develop a regularized non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to decompose the sub-sampled image stack into spectral signatures and concentration maps. This design enables an acquisition speed of 0.8\,s per image stack, with 50 frames in the spectral domain and 40,000 pixels in the spatial domain, which is faster than the conventional raster laser-scanning scheme by one order of magnitude. Such speed allows real-time metabolic imaging of living fungi suspended in a growth medium while effectively maintaining the spatial and spectral resolutions. This work is expected to promote broad application of matrix completion in spectroscopic laser-scanning imaging.},

The approach is based on common-path Fourier Domain OCT (CP-FDOCT), which can lead to applications for both microsurgical tool control and high-resolution endoscopic imaging. The system utilizes a combination of standard fiber optic components and novel signal processing techniques in order to achieve high axial resolution and to simplify the system. High axial resolution is achieved by implementing the Enhanced Lee filter to reduce speckle noise in the OCT image and Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm afterwards to suppress sidelobes induced by the system's point spread function. This also improves the lateral resolution. Utilizing the simple CP-FDOCT and this algorithm, using an onion as a sample, we have obtained images that have improved resolution and signal to noise ratio by 6dB.},

Non-uniform rotation distortion was corrected using a feature tracking-based technique, which enables robust, frame-to-frame analysis of the temporal fluctuation of the complex OCT signal. With proper noise calibration, precise delineation of the thermal therapy zone was demonstrated using cumulative complex differential variance in porcine esophagus ex vivo with the integrated OCT-RFA system, as validated by nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBTC) histology. The ability to directly and accurately visualize the thermal coagulation process at high resolution is critical to the precise delivery of thermal energy to a wide range of epithelial lesions.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study was designed to utilize optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of coronary atherosclerotic plaque macrophages to investigate the relationship between macrophage distributions and clinical syndrome. BACKGROUND The relative significance of focal macrophage infiltration and generalized coronary inflammation for predicting acute coronary events is a currently a source of considerable controversy in cardiology. Lack of a high-resolution cross-sectional imaging modality has limited macrophage evaluation in vivo. METHODS Intracoronary OCT imaging was performed at culprit and non-culprit plaques in patients presenting with stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Macrophage densities were quantified from these images and analyzed with respect to the clinical presentations of the patients under investigation. RESULTS A significantly greater macrophage density was found in unstable patients, both for fibrous and lipid-rich plaques (p ϭ 0.025 and p ϭ 0.002, respectively). Within each patient, the macrophage densities at culprit and non-culprit lesions correlated significantly (r ϭ 0.66, y ϭ 0.88x ϩ 0.43, p ϭ 0.01). Sites of plaque rupture demonstrated a greater macrophage density than non-ruptured sites (6.95 Ϯ 1.60\%, 5.29 Ϯ 1.17\%; p ϭ 0.002). Surface macrophage infiltration was a stronger predictor of unstable clinical presentation than subsurface infiltration for culprit lesions (p ϭ 0.035) but not for remote lesions (p ϭ 0.80). CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that increases in both multi-focal and focal macrophage densities are highly correlated with symptom severity. By providing a means of detecting increases in plaque macrophage content before an acute event, this technique may aid in determining prognosis and guiding preventive therapy.

  abstract = {Voice disorders affect a large number of adults in the United States, and their clinical evaluation heavily relies on laryngeal videostroboscopy, which captures the mediallateral and anterior-posterior motion of the vocal folds using stroboscopic sampling. However, videostroboscopy does not provide direct visualization of the superior-inferior movement of the vocal folds, which yields important clinical insight. In this paper, we present a novel technology that complements videostroboscopic findings by adding the ability to image the coronal plane and visualize the superior-inferior movement of the vocal folds. The technology is based on optical coherence tomography, which is combined with videostroboscopy within the same endoscopic probe to provide spatially and temporally co-registered images of the mucosal wave motion, as well as vocal folds subsurface morphology. We demonstrate the capability of the rigid endoscopic probe, in a benchtop setting, to characterize the complex movement and subsurface structure of the aerodynamically driven excised larynx models within the 50 to 200 Hz phonation range. Our preliminary results encourage future development of this technology with the goal of its use for in vivo laryngeal imaging.},

  abstract = {We present a system capable of real-time delivery and monitoring of laser therapy by imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) through a double-clad fiber (DCF). A double-clad fiber coupler is used to inject and collect OCT light into the core of a DCF and inject the therapy light into its larger inner cladding, allowing for both imaging and therapy to be perfectly coregistered. Monitoring of treatment depth is achieved by calculating the speckle intensity decorrelation occurring during tissue coagulation. Furthermore, an analytical noise correction was used on the correlation to extend the maximum monitoring depth. We also present a method for correcting motion-induced decorrelation using a lookup table. Using the value of the noise- and motion-corrected correlation coefficient in a novel approach, our system is capable of identifying the depth of thermal coagulation in real time and automatically shut the therapy laser off when the targeted depth is reached. The process is demonstrated ex vivo in rat tongue and abdominal muscles for depths ranging from 500 \textmu m to 1000 \textmu m with induced motion in real time.},

  abstract = {Optimal sensor placement is a central challenge in the design, prediction, estimation, and control of high-dimensional systems. High-dimensional states can often leverage a latent low-dimensional representation, and this inherent compressibility enables sparse sensing. This article explores optimized sensor placement for signal reconstruction based on a tailored library of features extracted from training data. Sparse point sensors are discovered using the singular value decomposition and QR pivoting, which are two ubiquitous matrix computations that underpin modern linear dimensionality reduction. Sparse sensing in a tailored basis is contrasted with compressed sensing, a universal signal recovery method in which an unknown signal is reconstructed via a sparse representation in a universal basis. Although compressed sensing can recover a wider class of signals, we demonstrate the benefits of exploiting known patterns in data with optimized sensing. In particular, drastic reductions in the required number of sensors and improved reconstruction are observed in examples ranging from facial images to fluid vorticity fields. Principled sensor placement may be critically enabling when sensors are costly and provides faster state estimation for low-latency, high-bandwidth control.},

The aim of this study is to assess the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with exercise-related acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presenting with inconclusive angiographic findings.               Background               . Regular physical activity reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the risk of ACS or sudden cardiac death (SCD) increases during sport. In adults older than 35 years, exercise-related ACS or SCD is associated with plaque rupture, but not infrequently patients present ambiguous angiographic findings.               Methods               . Between September 2015 and January 2020, patients admitted for ACS or SCD triggered by physical exertion and with coronary stenosis {$\leq$}50\% were included in this prospective observational study. OCT was performed on the artery deemed to be responsible of the event.               Results               . Ten patients were enrolled, predominantly men (80\%) of middle age (51 years old, IQR 41\textendash 63) with low cardiovascular risk burden. Cycling was the most frequent (50\%) exercise-related trigger, 8 patients were regular sport practitioners, and 7 had the clinical event during strenuous exertion. Five patients presented with non-ST-elevation ACS, two with ST-elevation ACS, and three with SCD. Angiographic analysis showed nonsignificant stenosis in all patients (42\% stenosis, IQR 36\textendash 46). OCT identified the etiology of the event in 9 patients (4 plaque erosion, 3 plaque rupture, 1 eruptive calcific nodule, and 1 coronary dissection). Treatment was adjusted according to OCT findings.               Conclusions               . OCT is a valuable technique to identify the etiology of exercise-related ACS or SCD in patients with nonobstructive coronary arteries and, as a result, may lead to a more specific treatment.},

  abstract = {We present the first, most compact, ultrahigh-resolution, high-speed, distal scanning optical coherence tomography (OCT) endoscope operating at 800 nm. Achieving high speed imaging while maintaining an ultrahigh axial resolution is one of the most significant challenges with endoscopic OCT at 800 nm. Maintaining an ultrahigh axial resolution requires preservation of the broad spectral bandwidth of the light source throughout the OCT system. To overcome this critical limitation we implemented a distal scanning endoscope with diffractive optics to minimize loss in spectral throughput. In this paper, we employed a customized miniature 900 \textmu m diameter DC micromotor fitted with a micro reflector to scan the imaging beam. We integrated a customized diffractive microlens into the imaging optics to reduce chromatic focal shift over the broad spectral bandwidth of the Ti:Sapphire laser of an approximately 150 nm 3dB bandwidth, affording a measured axial resolution of 2.4 \textmu m (in air). The imaging capability of this high-speed, ultrahigh-resolution distal scanning endoscope was validated by performing 3D volumetric imaging of mouse colon in vivo at 50 frames-per-second (limited only by the A-scan rate of linear CCD array in the spectral-domain OCT system and sampling requirements). The results demonstrated that fine microstructures of colon could be clearly visualized, including the boundary between the absorptive cell layer and colonic mucosa as well the crypt patterns. Furthermore, this endoscope was employed to visualize morphological changes in an enterotoxigenic Bacteriodes fragilis (ETBF) induced colon tumor model. We present the results of our feasibility studies and suggest the potential of this system for visualizing time dependent morphological changes associated with tumorigenesis on murine models in vivo.},

The methods of image motion analysis described in this book use the calculus of variations to minimize (or maximize) an objective functional which transcribes all of the constraints that characterize the desired motion variables. The book addresses the four core subjects of motion analysis: Motion estimation, detection, tracking, and three-dimensional interpretation. Each topic is covered in a dedicated chapter. The presentation is prefaced by an introductory chapter which discusses the purpose of motion analysis. Further, a chapter is included which gives the basic tools and formulae related to curvature, Euler Lagrange equations, unconstrained descent optimization, and level sets, that the variational image motion processing methods use repeatedly in the book},

We searched on online databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science, and obtained additional studies through citation tracking. Case reports and review articles were excluded. A total of 47 articles were included in our review. We describe that patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, preeclampsia, coronary artery disease, carotid artery stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome have, in general, lower retinal and choroidal Vessel Density (VD) and Length (VL), as well as an increased foveal avascular zone area and perimeter. Additionally, several characteristics and/or conditions in healthy subjects, such as smoking status, hyper or hypoxia conditions, race, among others, are also related to ocular vascular changes and should be accounted for. We concluded that OCTA could be a useful tool to assess a patient's CV risk profile in a noninvasive way, possibly integrating the diagnostic and prognostic algorithms of the most prevalent CV diseases in the future.},

We propose and evaluate the application of intrinsically illumination-invariant census transforms within a dense state-of-the-art variational optical flow computation scheme. Our technique improves robustness against illumination changes, caused either by altering physical illumination or camera parameter adjustments. Since census signatures can be implemented quite efficiently, the resulting optical flow fields can be computed in real-time.},

  abstract = {Vitreo-retinal surgery concerns a set of particularly demanding micro-surgical interventions that take place at the back of the eye. Expert micro-surgeons are to manipulate fragile membranes or vessels while taking great care not to damage the underlying retina. Despite using high quality stereo microscopes, depth perception remains limited. Efforts have been conducted to enhance depth awareness through adding OCT or even force sensing. Whereas OCT has been predominantly used to assist in retinal membrane peeling procedures, so far little work has been conducted to use it for offering assistance during retinal vein cannulation. This abstract describes some first results of a novel algorithm that has been designed to reliably estimate the distance to the retina from an instrument with integrated OCTfiber. However, it is anticipated that the algorithm can be further expanded to estimate other useful characteristics as well. It could for example help to automatically detect vessels on the retina, or to estimate the diameter or center of a targeted vessel. Equipped with this knowledge more sophisticated assistive control schemes could be designed to further increase cannulation reliability.},

Standard treatment for most of the tumors is radical surgery combined with stage-based neo-/adjuvant therapy. Laser surgery has become a reliable treatment option for oral cancer as well as for precancerous lesions. Widely used lasers in oral and maxillofacial tumor surgery are the CO2 laser, the Er:YAG laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the KTM laser. The use of lasers in tumor surgery has several advantages: remote application, precise cutting, hemostasis, low cicatrization, reduced postoperative pain and swelling, can be combined with endoscopic, microscopic and robotic surgery. However, laser surgery has some major drawbacks: In contrast to conventional incisions with scalpels, the surgeon gets no feedback during laser ablation. There is no depth sensation and no tissue specificity with a laser incision, increasing the risk of iatrogenic damage to nerves and major blood vessels. Future prospects may solve these problems by means of an optical feedback mechanism that provides a tissue-specific laser ablation. First attempts have been made to perform remote optical tissue differentiation. Additionally, real time optical tumor detection during laser surgery would allow for a very precise and straight forward cancer resection, enhancing organ preservation and hence the quality of life for patients with cancer in the head and neck region.},

Increases in OCT speed have reduced motion artifacts by enabling acquisition faster than or comparable to the time scales of physiological motion. However motion distortion remains a challenge because catheter/endoscope OCT imaging involves both circumferential and longitudinal scanning of tissue. This paper presents a novel image processing method to estimate and correct motion distortion in both the circumferential and longitudinal directions using a single en face image from a volumetric data set. The circumferential motion distortion is estimated and corrected using the en face image. Then longitudinal motion distortion is estimated and corrected using diversity of image features along the catheter pullback direction. Finally, the OCT volume is resampled and motion corrected. Results are presented on synthetic images and clinical OCT images of the human esophagus.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous pathohistological studies demonstrated that cholesterol crystals (CCs) are frequently observed in atherosclerotic plaques, and are usually present abundantly in vulnerable plaques. However, the role of CCs in plaque destabilization, as well as their origin and composition, is unknown. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging system is a high-resolution imaging device, which allows the in vivo identification of CCs accumulating within atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of CCs, other plaque morphologies assessed by OCT, and patients' clinical characteristics including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods and results: Preinterventional OCT images of 173 patients with either ACS or stable angina pectoris were studied. Of 173 lesions in the patients, 66 (38\%) had CCs within the culprit lesion segment and 107 (62\%) had non-CC lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, the presence of plaque rupture, intimal vasculature, and thrombus were independent factors associated with CCs. Moreover, the frequency of CCs increased in proportion to the accumulation of the number of components of their vulnerable plaque features within the culprit lesion segment. Compared with the plaques without thrombus, CCs were present at shallower locations in those with thrombus. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential correlation between the clinical metabolic disorder and vulnerable morphological features of culprit lesions to the presence of CCs in patients with stable and unstable coronary syndromes. These observations of CCs by using in vivo plaque imaging could provide incremental value to OCT evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques.},

  abstract = {Purpose Retinal vein cannulation is an experimental procedure during which a clot-dissolving drug is injected into an obstructed retinal vein. However, due to the fragility and minute size of retinal veins, such procedure is considered too risky to perform manually. With the aid of surgical robots, key limiting factors such as: unwanted eye rotations, hand tremor and instrument immobilization can be tackled. However, local instrument anatomy distance and force estimation remain unresolved issues. A reliable, real-time local interaction estimation between instrument tip and the retina could be a solution. This paper reports on the development of a combined force and distance sensing cannulation needle, and its experimental validation during in vivo animal trials. Methods Two prototypes are reported, relying on force and distance measurements based on FBG and OCT A-scan fibres, respectively. Both instruments provide an 80 \textmu m needle tip and have outer shaft diameters of 0.6 and 2.3 mm, respectively. Results Both prototypes were characterized and experimentally validated ex vivo. Then, paired with a previously developed surgical robot, in vivo experimental validation was performed. The first prototype successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a combined force and distance sensing instrument in an in vivo setting. Conclusion The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying a combined sensing instrument in an in vivo setting. The performed study provides a foundation for further work on real-time local modelling of the surgical scene. This paper provides initial insights; however, additional processing remains necessary.},

The mechanical cross-coupling between the transverse axes of a resonant fiber with a circular cross-section was completely eliminated by asymmetrically modulating the stiffness of the fiber cantilever with silicon microstructures and an off-set fiber fragment. The Lissajous fiber scanner was fully packaged as endomicroscopic catheter passing through the accessory channel of a clinical endoscope and combined with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Ex-vivo 3D OCT images were successfully reconstructed along Lissajous trajectory. The preview imaging capability of the Lissajous scanning enables rapid 3D imaging with high temporal resolution.

Along with the explanations of mechanism and design, the principle of actuation are provided for general readers. In this review, several testing methodology and examples are described based on many types of actuators, such as, electrothermal actuators, electrostatic actuators, electromagnetic actuators, pneumatic actuators, and shape memory alloy. Moreover, this review provides description of the key fabrication processes and common materials in order to be a basic guideline for selecting micro-actuators. With recent developments on scanning micromirrors, performances of biomedical application are enhanced for higher resolution, high accuracy, and high dexterity. With further developments on integrations and control schemes, MEMS-based scanning micromirrors would be able to achieve a better performance for medical applications due to small size, ease in microfabrication, mass production, high scanning speed, low power consumption, mechanical stable, and integration compatibility.},

  abstract = {Objectives: There have been many advancements in laryngeal imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT), with varying system design and probes for use in research, office, and operating room settings. We evaluated the performance of six distinct OCT systems in imaging porcine vocal folds (cords) using computational image processing and segmentation. Methods: Porcine vocal folds were scanned using six OCT systems. Imaging system and probe performance were quantitatively assessed for signal penetration, layer differentiation, and epithelium (EP) measurement. Fitted exponential decay curves with corresponding {$\alpha$} constant and intensity thresholding segmentation were utilized to quantify the aforementioned parameters. Results: The smallest average {$\alpha$} constant and deepest signal penetration was of the SS-OCT 1700 nm 90 kHz microscope system ({$\alpha$}= -1.74), followed by the SS-OCT 1310 nm 200 kHz VCSEL microscope system ({$\alpha$}= -1.99), and SS-OCT 1310 nm 50 kHz rigid forward viewing endoscope system ({$\alpha$}= -2.23). The EP was not readily visualized for three out of six systems, but was detected using automated segmentation. Average EP thickness (mean {$\pm$} SD) was calculated as 55.79 {$\pm$} 31.86 mm which agrees favorably with previous literature. Conclusion: Comparisons of OCT systems are challenging, as they encompass different probe design, optical path, and lasers, depending on application. Practical evaluation of different systems using computer based quantitative image processing and segmentation revealed basic, constructive information, such as EP measurements. To further validate the comparisons of system performance with clinical usability, in vivo human laryngeal imaging will be conducted. Further},

This contribution describes a dense optical flow-based solution enabling the point correspondence determination in such scenes. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method were validated using results obtained for a phantom with known dimensions and with real medical data, respectively.

Due to the limited bandwidth of digitizers and the speed limitations of beam steering using mechanical scanners, meter-scale FMCW LiDAR systems typically suffer from a low 3D frame rate, which greatly restricts their applications in real-time imaging of dynamic scenes. In this work, we report a high-speed FMCW based 3D imaging system, combining a grating for beam steering with a compressed time-frequency analysis approach for depth retrieval. We thoroughly investigate the localization accuracy and precision of our system both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate 3D imaging results of multiple static and moving objects, including a flexing human hand. The demonstrated technique achieves submillimeter localization accuracy over a tens-of-centimeter imaging range with an overall depth voxel acquisition rate of 7.6\,MHz, enabling densely sampled 3D imaging at video rate.},

Optical fiber-based imaging modalities permit the use of remote illumination sources and enable flexible forms supporting the creation of portable and hand-held imaging instrumentations to interrogate within hollow tissue cavities. A common challenge in the development of such devices is the design and integration of miniaturized optical and mechanical components. Until recently, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and actuators have been playing a key role in shaping the miniaturization of these components. This is due to the precision mechanics of MEMS, microfabrication techniques, and optical functionality enabling a wide variety of movable and tunable mirrors, lenses, filters, and other optical structures. Many promising results from MEMS based optical fiber endoscopy have demonstrated great potentials for clinical translation. In this article, reviews of MEMS sensors and actuators for various fiber-optical endoscopy such as fluorescence, optical coherence tomography, confocal, photo-acoustic, and two-photon imaging modalities will be discussed.

  abstract = {We examine high accuracy stereo estimation for binocular sequences that where obtained from a mobile platform. The ultimate goal is to improve the range of stereo systems without altering the setup. Based on a well-known variational optical flow model, we introduce a novel stereo model that features a second-order regularization, which both allows sub-pixel accurate solutions and piecewise planar disparity maps. The model incorporates a robust fidelity term to account for adverse illumination conditions that frequently arise in real-world scenes. Using several sequences that were taken from a mobile platform we show the robustness and accuracy of the proposed model.},

Methods\textemdash Using the Niris OCT imaging system (Imalux, Cleveland, OH), we obtained OCT images of benign and premalignant laryngeal disease in 33 patients undergoing surgical head and neck endoscopy. This imaging system has a spatial depth resolution of 10 to 20 \textmu m and a depth scanning range of 2.2 mm, obtaining images of 200 \texttimes{} 200 pixels at a maximum frame rate of 0.7 Hz. The scanning mechanism of the device is located at the distal end of a flexible probe that is placed in contact or near-contact with the area of interest. The tip of the probe was inserted through a rigid laryngoscope, and still images were obtained. Results\textemdash OCT images of arytenoids, aryepiglottic folds, piriform sinus, epiglottis, and true and false vocal cords were obtained. In patients whose OCT images were taken from normal tissue, the normal microstructures were clearly identified, as well as disruption of the latter in malignant pathologies. Conclusions\textemdash The device can easily be incorporated into the operating room and requires minimal set-up and staff to operate. OCT imaging with this device potentially offers an efficient, quick, and reliable imaging modality in guiding surgical biopsies, intraoperative decision making, and therapeutic options of various laryngeal pathologies and premalignant disease.},

OCT's greatest impact so far in the GI tract has been in the study of the tubular esophagus owing to its accessibility, less bends and folds and allowance of balloon employment with optimal contact to aid circumferential imaging. Moreover, given the alarming rise in the incidence of Barrett's esophagus and its progression to adenocarcinoma in the U.S., OCT has helped identify pathological features that may guide future therapy and follow-up strategy. This review will explore the current uses of OCT in the gastrointestinal tract and future directions, particularly with non-endoscopic office-based capsule OCT and the use of artificial intelligence to aid in diagnoses.},

  abstract = {Background: The advantage of photodynamic diagnosis in detecting urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder has been demonstrated clearly, but it comes at the price of a higher falsepositive rate. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, real-time, microstructural imaging modality that uses near-infrared light for a point analysis of the bladder-wall microstructure. Objective: To evaluate whether adding targeted OCT analysis of lesions that are suspicious at white-light (WL) and hexaminolevulinate (HAL) fluorescence cystoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy in the detection of UCC. Design, setting, and participants: In this prospective single-center study with same-patient comparison, patients with suspected UCC first received an intravesical instillation of HAL. Cystoscopy was performed in WL, followed by blue-light inspection and OCT scanning. Intervention: Suspicious lesions identified by WL or HAL were evaluated by OCT and were subsequently resected or biopsied. Measurements: We measured changes in sensitivity and specificity in detecting UCC using WL, HAL, and targeted OCT. Results and limitations: In 66 patients studied, 232 lesions were detected, were scanned by OCT, and were subsequently resected or biopsied. Additionally, 132 areas of normal-appearing urothelium were investigated by all three methods and biopsied. On a per-lesion basis, sensitivity and specificity were respectively 69.3\% and 83.7\% for WL, 97.5\% and 78.6\% for HAL, and 97.5\% and 97.9\% for HAL combined with OCT. Overall, UCC was diagnosed in 58 patients (87.9\%), with a per-patient sensitivity of 89.7\% for WL and 100\% for both HAL alone and HAL with targeted OCT. Per-patient specificity for HAL alone and targeted HAL was 62.5\% and 87.5\%, respectively. The limitation of OCT results from poor visualization of flat lesions in WL, making scanning a time-consuming procedure. Conclusions: Combining fluorescence cystoscopy with targeted OCT increases the specificity of fluorescence cystoscopy significantly, with no added morbidity, and reduces the need for unnecessary (false-positive) biopsies.},

  abstract = {High quality, large size volumetric imaging of biological tissue with optical coherence tomography (OCT) requires large number and high density of scans, which results in large data acquisition volume. This may lead to corruption of the data with motion artifacts related to natural motion of biological tissue, and could potentially cause conflicts with the maximum permissible exposure of biological tissue to optical radiation. Therefore, OCT can benefit greatly from different approaches to sparse or compressive sampling of the data where the signal is recovered from its sub-Nyquist measurements. In this paper, a new energy-guided compressive sensing approach is proposed for improving the quality of images acquired with Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT) and reconstructed from sparse data sets. The proposed algorithm learns an optimized sampling probability density function based on the energy distribution of the training data set, which is then used for sparse sampling instead of the commonly used uniformly random sampling. It was demonstrated that the proposed energy-guided learning approach to compressive FD-OCT of retina images requires 45\% fewer samples in comparison with the conventional uniform compressive sensing (CS) approach while achieving similar reconstruction performance. This novel approach to sparse sampling has the potential to significantly reduce data acquisition while maintaining image quality.},

Current devices use fiber bundles or silicon image sensors placed in the distal tip where each pixel in the image is derived from an element in the distal tip, such that improving resolution requires increasing distal tip diameter. The University of Washington has developed the scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) to provide full color, high resolution images from a flexible endoscope with a small distal tip diameter. The SFE uses a single mode fiber vibrating in resonance to scan a focused laser spot over the tissue and a detector to record the time-multiplexed backscatter signal. The SFE contains a 400 micron diameter piezoelectric tube through which a length of singlemode optical fiber is placed. The tube drives the fiber tip at its resonant frequency (currently 5 KHz) in an expanding pattern of 250 spirals (500 pixel diameter image) at a frame rate of 15 Hertz. Imaging parameters are determined by the lens system placed in the 1.06 mm diameter distal tip. Prototype systems with 70 degree field-of-view and 10 micron resolution have been developed. Color images are created with red, green, and blue laser sources coupled into the single scanning fiber. Backscattered light is collected with twelve 250 micron multimode fibers placed around the periphery of the microscanner resulting in a total distal tip diameter of 1.6 mm. Frame sequential color, fluorescence, and continuous color imaging modes have been demonstrated in the non-confocal geometry.},

  abstract = {Flexible endoscopes use one sensor element per display pixel. When diameter is reduced to the size of a catheter, there is a significant reduction in the number of pixels within the image. By placing a sub-millimeter microscanner at the tip of a catheter, image quality can be significantly improved. The microscanner consists of a 0.4 mm diameter piezoelectric tube with quadrant electrodes, surrounding a cantilevered singlemode optical fiber. At the distal end, the fiber microscanner is sealed with a 0.9 mm diameter lens assembly, creating a rigid length less than 10 mm at the tip of a highly flexible shaft. The cantilevered fiber is vibrated at the first mode of resonance for bending to generate a circular scan pattern. A spiral scan pattern is generated that constitutes an image frame by modulating the piezoelectric drive signals. By using a custom optical fiber at 80 microns cladding diameter, {$>$}10 KHz resonant scanning is achieved, resulting in a 30 Hz frame rate. Red (635 nm), green (532 nm), and blue (442 nm) laser light is scanned by coupling to the fiber scanner. The scanned illumination is detected in a non-confocal arrangement by having one or more optical fibers collecting the backscattered light at MHz pixel rates. Current 1-mm diameter catheterscopes generate 500-line images at maximum fields of view of 100 degrees and spatial resolutions of {$<$}20 microns with image zooming. Shaft length of four meters have been fabricated with flexibility of {$<$}10 mm bending radius to image previously inaccessible regions of the body.},

Methods: The CONNECT II study was a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized singlearm study of the safety and effectiveness of the Ocelot catheter in CTO crossing. Key inclusion criteria were a 99\% to 100\% stenosed femoropopliteal segment, lesion length between 1 and 30 cm, and resistance to guidewire crossing. The main exclusion criterion was a severely calcified target vessel. The primary safety endpoint was 30-day major adverse events (MAE), while the primary effectiveness endpoint was successful CTO crossing (i.e., guidewire placement in the distal true lumen) with the Ocelot catheter. Endpoint analysis was based on pre-specified objective performance criteria. Between February and June 2012, 100 patients (55 men; mean age 69 years) were enrolled. Most of the CTOs (94\%) were in the superficial femoral artery (SFA); mean lesion length was 16.669.3 cm. Results: Through 30 days, 2 patients experienced MAE (significant perforations) related to the Ocelot catheter. The Ocelot catheter successfully crossed 97\% of target CTOs either alone (72\%), in conjunction with an assist device (18\%), or in conjunction with a re-entry device (7\%). Both primary safety and effectiveness endpoints were met. Conclusion: The Ocelot catheter with optical coherence tomography guidance offers physicians a reliable option for crossing femoral and popliteal chronic total occlusions with low MAE rates.},

By bringing together all aspects of microsystem design, it can be expected to facilitate the training of not only a new generation of engineers, but perhaps a whole new type of engineer \textendash{} one capable of addressing the complex range of problems involved in reducing entire systems to the micro- and nano-domains. This book breaks down disciplinary barriers to set the stage for systems we do not even dream of today. Microsystems have a long history, dating back to the earliest days of mic- electronics. While integrated circuits developed in the early 1960s, a number of laboratories worked to use the same technology base to form integrated sensors. The idea was to reduce cost and perhaps put the sensors and circuits together on the same chip. By the late-60s, integrated MOS-photodiode arrays had been developed for visible imaging, and silicon etching was being used to create thin diaphragms that could convert pressure into an electrical signal. By 1970, selective anisotropic etching was being used for diaphragm formation, retaining a thick silicon rim to absorb package-induced stresses. Impurity- and electrochemically-based etch-stops soon emerged, and "bulk micromachining" came into its own.},

Therefore, it can classify the type of contour pixels as a straight line, inner corner, outer corner and inner-outer corner, and it can extract pixels of a specific contour type. Moreover, it can trace contour pixels rapidly because it can determine the local minimal path using the contour case. In addition, the proposed algorithm is capable of the compressing data of contour pixels using the representative points and inner-outer corner points, and it can accurately restore the contour image from the data. To compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to that of conventional techniques, we measure their processing time and accuracy. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance compared to the others. Furthermore, it can provide the compressed data of contour pixels and restore them accurately, including the inner-outer corner, which cannot be restored using conventional algorithms.},

A flexible optical coherence tomography probe was inserted through the nose and placed in near or gentle contact with laryngeal tissues under direct endoscopic visualization. RESULTS\textemdash Images were successfully obtained from all laryngeal subsites and clearly identified laryngeal mucosal microanatomy. Several critical probe design modifications improved rotational and angular control of the distal tip while allowing linear translation of the probe and allowing more accurate apposition of the probe onto target tissues, which is critical for transnasal laryngeal imaging.

  abstract = {Visual tracking of general objects often relies on the assumption that gradient descent of the alignment function will reach the global optimum. A common technique to smooth the objective function is to blur the image. However, blurring the image destroys image information, which can cause the target to be lost. To address this problem we introduce a method for building an image descriptor using distribution fields (DFs), a representation that allows smoothing the objective function without destroying information about pixel values. We present experimental evidence on the superiority of the width of the basin of attraction around the global optimum of DFs over other descriptors. DFs also allow the representation of uncertainty about the tracked object. This helps in disregarding outliers during tracking (like occlusions or small misalignments) without modeling them explicitly. Finally, this provides a convenient way to aggregate the observations of the object through time and maintain an updated model. We present a simple tracking algorithm that uses DFs and obtains state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: The goal of this study is to apply a new bioimaging modality, the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), for intraoperative control in laser surgery of laryngeal carcinoma. Study Design/Materials and Methods: We studied 26 patients with laryngeal carcinoma in situ and in T1, T2 stage. We used an endoscopic OCT device for imaging at a wavelength of 0.83 mm with the acquisition rate of approximately 0.5 frames/s for a single (200 \^A 200 pixel) tomogram. All patients were operated with a surgical YAG:Nd laser at two switchable wavelengths of 1.44 mm and 1.32 mm by laryngo\textregistered ssure, direct microlaryngoscopy, and \textregistered brolaryngoscopy. Results: Information on structural alterations in laryngeal mucosa to the depth of 2 mm, obtained by OCT, makes it possible to precisely locate tumor borders, thus giving an opportunity to control the surgical treatment of laryngeal carcinoma. The YAG:Nd laser scalpel with wavelengths of 1.32 mm and 1.44 mm is successful in surgical procedures both in open and closed larynx due to ef\textregistered cient coagulation and minimization of collateral tissue damage area. Combination of the two wavelengths in the single laser unit and intraoperative OCT monitoring result is a new modality for minimally invasive larynx surgery. Conclusions: OCT is promising to become a new diagnosing method of laryngeal carcinoma and a tool for laser treatment monitoring. J. Surg. Oncol. 2001;77:253{$\pm$}258. \ss{} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6\% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8\% per year in men and by 1.6\% per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1\% per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4\% and 2.3\% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40\% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34\% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

A US-based multi-center registry was constructed to prospectively collect data on patients undergoing upper endoscopy during which a VLE scan was performed. The objective of this registry was to determine usage patterns of VLE in clinical practice and to estimate quantitative and qualitative performance metrics as they are applied to Barrett's esophagus (BE) management. All procedures utilized the NvisionVLE Imaging System (NinePoint Medical, Bedford, MA) which was used by investigators to identify the tissue types present, along with focal areas of concern. Following the VLE procedure, investigators were asked to answer six key questions regarding how VLE impacted each case. Statistical analyses including neoplasia diagnostic yield improvement using VLE was performed. One thousand patients were enrolled across 18 US trial sites from August 2014 through April 2016. In patients with previously diagnosed or suspected BE (894/1000), investigators used VLE and identified areas of concern not seen on white light endoscopy (WLE) in 59\% of the procedures. VLE imaging also guided tissue acquisition and treatment in 71\% and 54\% of procedures, respectively. VLE as an adjunct modality improved the neoplasia diagnostic yield by 55\% beyond the standard of care practice. In patients with no prior history of therapy, and without visual findings from other technologies, VLE-guided tissue acquisition increased neoplasia detection over random biopsies by 700\%. Registry investigators reported that VLE improved the BE management process when used as an adjunct tissue acquisition and treatment guidance tool. The ability of VLE to image large segments of the esophagus with microscopic cross-sectional detail may provide additional benefits including higher yield biopsies and more efficient tissue acquisition.

Retinal vein cannulation followed by injection of an anti-coagulant into the affected vein is a promising treatment. However, given the scale and fragility of the surgical workfield, this procedure is considered too high-risk to perform manually. A first successful robot-assisted procedure has been demonstrated. Even though successful, the procedure remains extremely challenging. This paper aims at providing a solution for the limited perception of instrument-tissue interaction forces as well as depth estimation during retinal vein cannulation. The development of a novel combined force and distance sensing cannulation needle relying on Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) A-scan technology is reported. The design, the manufacturing process, the calibration method, and the experimental characterization of the produced sensor are discussed. The functionality of the combined sensing modalities and the real-time distance estimation algorithm are validated respectively on in-vitro and ex-vivo models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach for the estimation of visual motion over an image sequence in real-time. A new algorithm is proposed which solves the correspondence problem between two images in a very efficient way. The method uses the Census Transform as the representation of small image patches. These primitives are matched using a table based indexing scheme. We demonstrate the robustness of this technique on real-world image sequences of a road scenario captured from a vehicle based on-board camera. We focus on the computation of the optical flow. Our method runs in real-time on general purpose platforms and handles large displacements.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Although drug-eluting stents and intensive secondary prevention have contributed to improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), repeat revascularization remains relatively common in contemporary practice. We used data from the multicenter Evaluation of Drug-Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events registry to evaluate the relative frequency and timing of staged revascularization, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and other nontarget revascularization during the first year after contemporary PCI. Methods and Results\textemdash Patients with staged revascularization, TLR, and other unplanned procedures (elsewhere in the target vessel or in other coronary arteries) were evaluated in time-dependent models using Kaplan-Meier life-table estimation. Predictors of TLR and unplanned revascularization at nontarget sites were identified using logistic regression. Between July 2004 to June 2007, 10 144 patients undergoing PCI were enrolled at 55 US hospitals, of whom 86\% were treated with at least 1 drug-eluting stent. Twelve percent required repeat revascularization within the first year (3\% staged; 9\% unplanned). More than 75\% of staged revascularizations were performed {$<$}30 days after index PCI, although there was significant variation in this practice across hospitals (range, 0\%\textendash 54\%). TLR occurred in 4.5\% of patients, with higher hazard rates between 2 to 9 months after PCI, whereas the risk of unplanned non-TLR (4.4\% cumulative incidence) was constant over time. Conclusions\textemdash Among unselected patients undergoing PCI in the drug-eluting stent era, the incidence of repeat revascularization at 1 year is {$\approx$}12\%. Among unplanned procedures, only half are performed for TLR. To achieve further improvements in PCI outcomes, future efforts should concentrate as much on identifying ischemia-producing lesions and intensifying secondary prevention therapies as on the prevention of restenosis.\hspace{0.6em} (Circ Cardiovasc Interv. 2012;5:772-782.)},

In order to realize the electromagneticallydriven scanning, a cylindrical magnet is fixed at the center of the polyimide pipe by an optical fiber. When an AC power is supplied to the microcoil, the fiber scanner is actuated under a certain frequency. The modal and dynamic response of the designed scanner under high-order vibration has been simulated and analyzed. The microcoil with 60\textdegree{} tilt angle is fabricated by wet etching and maskless electroplating processes. The electromagnetic property and maximum driven displacement of the fabricated device have been also evaluated, which is generally in accordance with that simulated. Finally, the electroplated microcoil of 60\textordmasculine{} tilt-angle, 40\textmu m line width, 40\textmu m line spacing and 15\textmu m thickness has been obtained successfully.},

A free-fixed optical fiber cantilever with a cylindrical magnet can be driven and vibrated by a tilted coil on a tube surface under electromagnetic force. The tiny coil with a large tilt angle as the actuator is fabricated by a new three-dimensional (3D) printing technology and handmade hybrid process. It is an efficient and low-cost method for fabricating tiny 3D tilted coils compared with the complicated micromachining process. A 2.0\,mm outer diameter tilted coil has been successfully developed. The line pitch, tilt angle, resistance and turns of this fabricated coil are 75\,\textmu m, 60\textdegree, 20\,{$\Omega$} and 100 turns, respectively. The scanning motion of the assembled scanner utilizing the fabricated 3D coil, fiber and a small magnet has been measured by a high-speed camera. The scanner consists of a 9\,mm-length optical fiber, a 2\,mm outer diameter cylindrical magnet, a jig and a fabricated tilted coil. The displacement of the fiber tip in the scanner is observed and measured when the alternative current-driven voltage was applied to the tilted coil, and 126.8\,\textmu m maximum displacement has been obtained. The present fiber scanner with 3D tilted coil has promise for use as an important inspecting device for biomedical endoscope application.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence and clinical relevance of Buried Barrett's (BB) epithelium after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in Barrett's esophagus (BE) is questioned. Recent studies using small optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheters for scanning underneath the neosquamous epithelium demonstrated a high prevalence of tissue structures that might correspond to BB. Histological correlation, however, is lacking. Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) is a novel balloon-based OCT imaging technique that provides a 6-cm long circumferential volumetric scan of the esophageal wall layers to a depth of 3 mm with a resolution comparable to low-power microscopy. AIM: To evaluate if post-RFA subsquamous structures, detected with VLE, actually correspond to BB and to pursue direct histological correlation of VLE images. METHODS: In-vivo VLE was performed to detect subsquamous structures suspicious for BB in patients with 100\% endoscopic regression of dysplastic Barrett's epithelium after RFA. Areas with suspicious subsquamous VLE structures were marked with electrocoagulation after which in-vivo VLE was repeated to confirm that the correct area was demarcated. These areas were subsequently resected endoscopically, followed by immediate ex-vivo VLE scanning to reconfirm the presence of the subsquamous VLE structures. Extensive histological sectioning was then performed and all histopathology slides were evaluated by an expert BE pathologist (blinded for VLE images). RESULTS: In 9 patients, 6 areas with suspicious subsquamous structures were seen on in-vivo VLE and resected. Ex-vivo VLE of these 6 ER specimens reconfirmed the presence of these subsquamous structures in 5 ER specimens. Extensive histological sectioning of these areas showed BB in one area. The other subsquamous VLE structures corresponded to dilated (ducts of) (sub)mucosal glands or blood vessels. CONCLUSION: VLE may potentially detect BB under endoscopically normal appearing neosquamous epithelium. However, most post-RFA subsquamous structures identified by in-vivo VLE did not correspond to BB. Further studies are required to identify VLE features that allow for differentiation of BB from normal subsquamous structures.},

Potential applications include navigating body lumens such as the fallopian tube, biliary ducts and cardiovascular system. A custom cover plate provides a rotationally symmetric double reflection of the OCT beam to deviate and focus the OCT beam out the side of the endoscope for cross-sectional imaging of the tubal lumen. Considerations in the choice of the scanning fiber are explored and a new technique to increase the divergence angle of the scanning fiber to improve system performance is presented. Resolution and the necessary scanning density requirements to achieve Nyquist sampling of the full image are considered. The novel optical design lays the groundwork for a new approach integrating side-viewing OCT into multimodality endoscopes for small lumen imaging.},

  abstract = {Robotic automation has the potential to assist human surgeons in performing suturing tasks in microsurgery, and in order to do so a robot must be able to guide a needle with sub-millimeter precision through soft tissue. This paper presents a robotic suturing system that uses 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for imaging feedback. Calibration of the robot-OCT and robot-needle transforms, wound detection, keypoint identification, and path planning are all performed automatically. The calibration method handles pose uncertainty when the needle is grasped using a variant of iterative closest points. The path planner uses the identified wound shape to calculate needle entry and exit points to yield an evenly-matched wound shape after closure. Experiments on tissue phantoms and animal tissue demonstrate that the system can pass a suture needle through wounds with 0.200 mm overall accuracy in achieving the planned entry and exit points, and over 20\texttimes{} more precise than prior autonomous suturing robots.},

It proposes a systematic and complete study on descriptor-based data-terms that lead to a robust variational optical flow model. Unlike the literature which most often only experimentally shows that a descriptor is illumination invariant, this contribution gives a theoretical proof of this invariance. First, a local illumination change model is proposed and used to mathematically check whether a descriptor is invariant or not with respect to illumination variations between images. Then, this contribution proposes two general mathematical formulations which can be used to design a wide variety of new illumination-invariant descriptors. To illustrate the interest of the proposed approach, two novel illumination-invariant descriptors are constructed using the proposed general formulations. Moreover, the performance of the descriptors was evaluated on numerous datasets with known ground truth optical flow, while the robustness of the variational optical flow approach was highlighted using complex medical image sequences without ground truth. These experimental results have shown that data-terms based on the proposed descriptors led to accurate and constant optical flow under varying illumination conditions.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical diagnostic modality that can acquire cross-sectional images of the microscopic structure of the esophagus, including Barrett's esophagus (BE) and associated dysplasia. We developed a swallowable tethered capsule OCT endomicroscopy (TCE) device that acquires high-resolution images of entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract luminal organs. This device has a potential to become a screening method that identifies patients with an abnormal esophagus that should be further referred for upper endoscopy. Currently, the characterization of the OCT-TCE esophageal wall data set is performed manually, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, since the capsule optics optimally focus light approximately 500 \textmu m outside the capsule wall and the best quality images are obtained when the tissue is in full contact with the capsule, it is crucial to provide feedback for the operator about tissue contact during the imaging procedure. In this study, we developed a fully automated algorithm for the segmentation of in vivo OCT-TCE data sets and characterization of the esophageal wall. The algorithm provides a two-dimensional representation of both the contact map from the data collected in human clinical studies as well as a tissue map depicting areas of BE with or without dysplasia. Results suggest that these techniques can potentially improve the current TCE data acquisition procedure and provide an efficient characterization of the diseased esophageal wall.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES We present the clinical imaging of human coronary arteries in vivo using a multimodality optical coherence tomography (OCT) and near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) intravascular imaging system and catheter. BACKGROUND Although intravascular OCT is capable of providing microstructural images of coronary atherosclerotic lesions, it is limited in its capability to ascertain the compositional/molecular features of plaque. A recent study in cadaver coronary plaque showed that endogenous NIRAF is elevated in necrotic core lesions. The combination of these 2 technologies in 1 device may therefore provide synergistic data to aid in the diagnosis of coronary pathology in vivo. METHODS We developed a dual-modality intravascular imaging system and 2.6-F catheter that can simultaneously acquire OCT and NIRAF data from the same location on the artery wall. This technology was used to obtain volumetric OCT-NIRAF images from 12 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Images were acquired during a brief, nonocclusive 3- to 4-ml/s contrast purge at a speed of 100 frames/s and a pullback rate of 20 or 40 mm/s. OCT-NIRAF data were analyzed to determine the distribution of the NIRAF signal with respect to OCT-delineated plaque morphological features. RESULTS High-quality intracoronary OCT and NIRAF image data ({$>$}50-mm pullback length) were successfully acquired without complication in all patients (17 coronary arteries). The maximum NIRAF signal intensity of each plaque was compared with OCT-defined type, showing a statistically significant difference between plaque types (1-way analysis of variance, p {$<$} 0.0001). Interestingly, coronary arterial NIRAF intensity was elevated only focally in plaques with a high-risk morphological phenotype (p {$<$} 0.05), including OCT fibroatheroma, plaque rupture, and fibroatheroma associated with in-stent restenosis. CONCLUSIONS This OCT-NIRAF study demonstrates that dual-modality microstructural and fluorescence intracoronary imaging can be safely and effectively conducted in human patients. Our findings show that NIRAF is associated with a high-risk morphological plaque phenotype. The focal distribution of NIRAF in these lesions furthermore suggests that this endogenous imaging biomarker may provide complementary information to that obtained by structural imaging alone.

Novel procedure modeling and intracoronary imaging techniques may offer critical insights on stent deformations and stent-wall interactions during bifurcation stenting procedures. Thus, we assessed coronary bifurcation stenting techniques using multimodal imaging and 3D modeling in reanimated swine hearts. Harvested swine hearts were reanimated using Visible Heart\textregistered{} methodologies and (under standard fluoroscopic guidance) used to test 1-stent (provisional and inverted provisional) and 2-stent (culotte, TAP and DK-crush) techniques on bifurcations within various coronary vessels using commercially available devices. Intracoronary angioscopy and frequency-domain optical-coherence-tomography (OCT) were obtained during the procedures. 3D OCT reconstruction and micro-computed tomography 3D modeling (post heart fixations) were used to assess stent deformations and stent-wall interactions. We conducted multiple stenting procedures and collected unique endoscopic and OCT images (and subsequent computational models from micro-CT) to assess stent deformations and device/wall interactions during different steps of bifurcation stenting procedures. Endoscopy, micro-CT and virtual reality processing documented that different 1- and 2-stent techniques, practiced according to experts' recommended steps, achieve optimal post-intervention stent conformation. As compared with intra-procedural endoscopy, software-generated 3D OCT images accurately depicted stent deformations during 1-stent techniques. On the opposite, during more complex 2-stent techniques, some defects were appreciated at 3D OCT reconstruction despite optimal 2D OCT images. This study provided unique insights regarding both stent deformations occurring in the course of bifurcation stenting and the efficacy of OCT to visualize them.},

We have previously reported use of OCT imaging of the vocal folds (VFs) during direct laryngoscopy with a probe held in contact or near-contact with the VFs. This aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel OCT system integrated with a surgical microscope to allow hands-free OCT imaging of the VFs, which could be performed simultaneously with microscopic visualization. Methods\textemdash We performed a prospective evaluation of a new method of acquiring OCT images of the VFs. Results\textemdash An OCT system was successfully integrated with a surgical microscope to permit noncontact OCT imaging of the VFs of 10 patients. With this novel device we were able to identify VF epithelium and lamina propria; however, the resolution was reduced compared to that achieved with the standard contact or near-contact OCT. Conclusions\textemdash Optical coherence tomography is able to produce high-resolution images of vocal fold mucosa to a maximum depth of 1.6 mm. It may be used in the diagnosis of VF lesions, particularly early squamous cell carcinoma, in which OCT can show disruption of the basement membrane. Mounting the OCT device directly onto the operating microscope allows hands-free noncontact OCT imaging and simultaneous conventional microscopic visualization of the VFs.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and is a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The clinical implication of subsurface glandular structures of Barrett's esophagus is not well understood. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), also known as volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE), can assess subsurface glandular structures, which appear as subsurface hyposcattering structures (SHSs). The aim of this study is to develop a computer-aided algorithm and apply it to investigate the characteristics of SHSs in BE using clinical VLE data; (2) Methods: SHSs were identified with an initial detection followed by machine learning. Comprehensive SHS characteristics including the number, volume, depth, size and shape were quantified. Clinical VLE datasets collected from 35 patients with a history of dysplasia undergoing BE surveillance were analyzed to study the general SHS distribution and characteristics in BE. A subset of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) patient data were further analyzed to investigate the pre-RFA SHS characteristics and post-RFA treatment response; (3) Results: SHSs in the BE region were significantly shallower, more vertical, less eccentric, and more regular, as compared with squamous SHSs. SHSs in the BE region which became neosquamous epithelium after RFA were shallower than those in the regions that remained BE. Pre-ablation squamous SHSs with higher eccentricity correlated strongly with larger reduction of post-ablation BE length for less elderly patients; (4) Conclusions: The computer algorithm is potentially a valuable tool for studying the roles of SHSs in BE.},

In this study, we investigate a method to extend the working distance of a commonpath SD-OCT system. Common-path OCT light, which consisting of sample and reference light signal, is directed into a free space optical interferometer. The OCT light is split spatially into two beam segments by a wavefront-splitting mirror, and the two parallel beams interfere noncollinearly in the interferometer. Distance between the end of the probing fiber, which serves as the reference plane of our OCT system, and the OCT sample is about 140 mm. The OCT performance is demonstrated by imaging biological samples. The proposed method can be used to develop polarization insensitive OCT probe for biomedical imaging applications.},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of layered tissue is the key to esophageal optical coherence tomography (OCT) image processing. With the advent of deep learning techniques, frameworks based on a fully convolutional network are proved to be effective in classifying pixels on images. However, due to speckle noise and unfavorable imaging conditions, the esophageal tissue relevant to the diagnosis is not always easy to identify. An effective approach to address this problem is extracting more powerful feature maps, which have similar expressions for pixels in the same tissue and show discriminability from those from different tissues. In this study, we proposed a novel framework, called the tissue self-attention network (TSA-Net), which introduces the self-attention mechanism for esophageal OCT image segmentation. The self-attention module in the network is able to capture long-range context dependencies from the image and analyzes the input image in a global view, which helps to cluster pixels in the same tissue and reveal differences of different layers, thus achieving more powerful feature maps for segmentation. Experiments have visually illustrated the effectiveness of the self-attention map, and its advantages over other deep networks were also discussed.},

Using modern endoscopic examination techniques mucosal changes can be detected early on in an office-based setting. However, the further classification of these lesions requires a surgical procedure with a biopsy taken under general anesthesia. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, light-based optical tool which can provide high-resolution cross-sectional images of tissue at near microscopic resolution. Applying it through a single mode optical fiber allows endoscopic approaches. Routine endoscopic assessment and a thin epithelial layer makes the larynx the perfect organ for implementing OCT into the clinical endoscopic routine. This review is focused on summarizing previous and ongoing translational applications of OCT imaging for tissue classification in the UADT focusing on the larynx, discussing limitations and benefits and offering an outlook on possible future applications.},

Sufficient sampling of the OCT imaging signal with uniform k interval are directly interpolated in the k-domain based on the spectral phase derived from MZI calibration signal. Depth profile is then obtained from Fourier transform of the k-domain interpolated data. In vivo imaging of human finger skin and nail fold are conducted. Reconstructed images corresponding to different calibration methods are evaluated for comparison.

An external clock uniform in K-space was generated. The clock was synchronized with the zero-crossing time of an interferometric calibration signal and used as triggers for a high-speed data acquisition system in a point-by-point fashion, hence enabling uniform data sampling in K-space. Different from the numerical calibration algorithm commonly used in an SS-OCT system, the method reported here does not require over-sampling, thus greatly reducing the demand for digitization, data processing and storage speed. The Rt-UKSS method is adaptive and applicable to a generic SS-OCT system of a wide range of A-scan rates without special adjustment. We successfully implemented the Rt-UKSS method in an SS-OCT system based on a Fourier-domain mode-locked laser (FDML) of a 40-kHz scanning rate. Real-time imaging of biological tissues using such a system was demonstrated with a measured axial resolution of 9.3 \textmu m and detection sensitivity greater than 120dB.},

We also implemented fast CS reconstruction by taking the advantage of fast Fourier transform (FFT). The matrix-vector multiplication commonly used in the CS reconstruction is implemented by a two-step procedure. Compared to the CS reconstruction with matrix multiplication, our method can obtain dispersion compensated A-scan at least 5 times faster.

  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a novel compressive sensing (CS) method in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT), which reconstructs B-scan image using a subset of the spectral data that is under-sampled in both axial and lateral dimensions. Thus a fraction of the A-scans for a B-scan are acquired; the spectral data of each acquired A-scan is under-sampled. Compared with the previous studies, our method further reduces the overall size of the spectral measurements. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain high quality B-scan image using 25\% spectral data, which takes 50\% number of A-scans and acquires 50\% spectral data for each selected A-scan.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash High-resolution visualization of atherosclerotic plaque morphology may be essential for identifying coronary plaques that cause acute coronary events. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an intravascular imaging modality capable of providing cross-sectional images of tissue with a resolution of 10 ␮m. To date, OCT imaging has not been investigated in sufficient detail to assess its accuracy for characterizing atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to establish objective OCT image criteria for atherosclerotic plaque characterization in vitro. Methods and Results\textemdash OCT images of 357 (diseased) atherosclerotic arterial segments obtained at autopsy were correlated with histology. OCT image criteria for 3 types of plaque were formulated by analysis of a subset (nϭ50) of arterial segments. OCT images of fibrous plaques were characterized by homogeneous, signal-rich regions; fibrocalcific plaques by well-delineated, signal-poor regions with sharp borders; and lipid-rich plaques by signal-poor regions with diffuse borders. Independent validation of these criteria by 2 OCT readers for the remaining segments (nϭ307) demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity ranging from 71\% to 79\% and 97\% to 98\% for fibrous plaques, 95\% to 96\% and 97\% for fibrocalcific plaques, and 90\% to 94\% and 90\% to 92\% for lipid-rich plaques, respectively (overall agreement, ␬ϭ0.83 to 0.84). The interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities of OCT assessment were high (␬ values of 0.88 and 0.91, respectively). Conclusions\textemdash Objective OCT criteria are highly sensitive and specific for characterizing different types of atherosclerotic plaques. These results represent an important step in validating this new intravascular imaging modality and will provide a basis for the interpretation of intracoronary OCT images obtained from patients.

A 2DOF system structure, including fiber, magnet, and weight, has been designed, which can execute high-order resonance modal to extend the scanning angle in the limited dimensional tube of the endoscope with 2-mm outer diameter. A low-cost, flexible microcoil embedded in polyimide film is also fabricated to drive the fiber-magnet-weight 2DOF system to vibrate. The magnetic field distributions of the microcoil with different structural parameters are simulated. The experimental measurement verifies that the scanner utilizing the second-order resonance mode has successfully realized a 9.47\textdegree{} scanning scale, which is much larger than the 2.98\textdegree{} obtained at the traditional first-order resonance mode. The scanning locus of fiber tip in the fabricated scanner probe has been obtained in the xy plane by standard position sensitive detector (PSD). The developed fiber scanner probe is promising to the ultrathin endoscope used in the narrow space of the human body.},

With the proposed system, confocal imaging of high optical sectioning ability can be achieved at sub-Nyquist sampling rates.

A single 80\,{$\mu$}m optical fiber is circularly vibrated by a piezo-electric tube to illuminate a field while the reflected light is collected to construct an image pixel-by-pixel. Accurate scanning of the optical fiber is paramount to image quality. Previously, an optical calibration chamber in the base station was used to calibrate the scanning of the optical fiber. This analytical and experimental work eliminates the use of the calibration chamber by implementing a new piezoelectric sensing approach enabling self-contained recalibration to maintain high-image quality during long medical procedures and also reducing the cost, size, and power consumption of the SFE. This work provides a major step toward self-calibration through adaptive control without additional sensors.},

The robot also allows for quick exchange of surgical graspers and the integration of a custom made B-mode OCT probe. The paper presents the kinematic modeling and calibration of the robot for demonstration of ocular and intraocular manipulation. The system telemanipulation framework is constructed and experimental evaluations of stent deployment and membrane peeling are shown with a verification of results using OCT probe images. We believe these preliminary results demonstrate new technology that may enable micro-vascular stenting for treatment of branch retinal vein occlusion while offering a general platform for dexterous retinal surgery.},

We identified characteristic optical coherence tomography patterns for nonproliferative and proliferative inflammation, and malignant alterations of the bladder. Materials and Methods: Optical coherence tomography was performed to image the bladder of 66 patients. The probe passed through the operating channel of a cystoscope and was pressed onto the mucosal site of interest. A mucosal biopsy of the image site was obtained. Optical coherence tomography was used to construct 680 images of the bladder and the images were compared with histology slides. Results: Optical coherence tomography images of normal bladder showed 3 layers, namely the mucosa or transitional epithelium, submucosa and smooth muscle. In exudative processes there were poor light scattering areas in the connective tissue layer. Images of bladders with proliferative cystitis revealed nonuniform thickening of the epithelium or hyperplasia. Squamous metaplasia appeared as thicker and less transparent epithelium with a jagged boundary. Images of transitional cell carcinoma were characterized by the complete loss of a regular layered structure of the bladder wall and the penetration depth of optical imaging was slight. Conclusions: This study provides the characteristic optical coherence tomography pattern of nonproliferative and proliferative inflammation, and the characteristic appearance of severe dysplasia and transitional cell carcinoma. This technique may be useful as a guide for biopsy and for assisting in establishing resection margins.},

The fiber was mounted at the proximal end of a quadruple PZT tube and scanned inside the hollow PZT tube to reduce the probe length. The fiber resonant frequency was 338 Hz using a 17-mm-long fiber. A 0.9 mm fiber deflection was achieved with a driving amplitude of 35 V. Using a GRIN lens-based optical design with a 1.3\texttimes{} magnification, a \textasciitilde 6 \textmu m spot was scanned over a 1.2 mm diameter field. The probe was encased in a metal hypodermic tube with a \textasciitilde 25 mm rigid length and covered with a 3.2 mm outer diameter (OD) plastic sheath. Imaging was performed with a swept source OCT system based on a Fourier domain modelocked laser (FDML) light source at a 240 kHz axial scan rate and 8 \textmu m axial resolution (in air). En face OCT imaging of skin in vivo and human colon ex vivo was demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Lasers have been proven to be precise tools for bone ablation. Applying no mechanical stress to the patient, they are potentially very suitable for microsurgery on fragile structures such as the inner ear. However, it remains challenging to control the laser-bone ablation without injuring embedded soft tissue. In this work, we demonstrate a closed-loop control of a short-pulsed CO               2               laser to perform laser cochleostomy under the monitoring of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. A foresighted detection of the bone-endosteum-perilymph boundary several hundred micrometers before its exposure has been realized. Position and duration of the laser pulses are planned based on the residual bone thickness distribution. OCT itself is also used as a highly accurate tracking system for motion compensation between the target area and the optics. During               ex vivo               experimental evaluation on fresh porcine cochleae, the ablation process terminated automatically when the thickness of the residual tissue layer uniformly reached a predefined value. The shape of the resulting channel bottom converged to the natural curvature of the endosteal layer without injuring the critical structure. Preliminary measurements in OCT scans indicated that the mean absolute accuracy of the shape approximation was only around 20\,               {$\mu$}               m.},

While labeling boundaries by manual to compute each layer's average thickness is time-consuming and subjective. In this paper, we present a new fully automatic algorithm which includes Fast Marching Method (FMM) and Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) to identify five esophagus layers on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. FMM is used to calculate the weighted geodesic distance. In particular, the velocity function involved in this method combines vertical gradient, horizontal gradient and curvature so that it not only can divide flat borders but also irregular borders. RK4 is used to find the shortest path which is the boundary to be segmented. The experimental comparison between automatic and manual is performed on 400 healthy guinea pig esophagus OCT images and the mean absolute error thickness difference between them is less than 6 pixels while the value can reach to 9.41 pixels at most between two observers.},

This supervised learning approach to dynamic sampling (SLADS) has the distinct advantage of being directly compatible with standard confocal Raman instrumentation. Furthermore, SLADS is not limited to Raman imaging, potentially providing time-savings in image reconstruction whenever the single-pixel measurement time is the limiting factor in image generation.},

Specifically, we propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a general {$\mathscr{l}$}1 norm CS reconstruction model. To cast ISTA into deep network form, we develop an effective strategy to solve the proximal mapping associated with the sparsity-inducing regularizer using nonlinear transforms. All the parameters in ISTA-Net (e.g. nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step sizes, etc.) are learned end-to-end, rather than being hand-crafted. Moreover, considering that the residuals of natural images are more compressible, an enhanced version of ISTA-Net in the residual domain, dubbed ISTA-Net+, is derived to further improve CS reconstruction. Extensive CS experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISTA-Nets outperform existing state-of-the-art optimization-based and networkbased CS methods by large margins, while maintaining fast computational speed.

A key unmet challenge is its limited throughput especially compared to rapid wide-field modalities that are used ubiquitously in thin specimens. Wide-field imaging methods in tissue specimens have found successes in optically cleared tissues and at shallower depths, but the scattering of emission photons in thick turbid samples severely degrades image quality at the camera. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel technique called De-scattering with Excitation Patterning or ``DEEP,'' which uses patterned nonlinear excitation followed by computational imaging\textendash assisted wide-field detection. Multiphoton temporal focusing allows high-resolution excitation patterns to be projected deep inside specimen at multiple scattering lengths due to the use of long wavelength light. Computational reconstruction allows high-resolution structural features to be reconstructed from tens to hundreds of DEEP images instead of millions of point-scanning measurements.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional signal recovery of standard linear regression is a key challenge in many engineering fields, such as, communications, compressed sensing, and image processing. The approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm proposed by Donoho et al is a computational efficient method to such problems, which can attain Bayes-optimal performance in independent identical distributed (IID) sub-Gaussian random matrices region. A significant feature of AMP is that the dynamical behavior of AMP can be fully predicted by a scalar equation termed station evolution (SE). Although AMP is optimal in IID sub-Gaussian random matrices, AMP may fail to converge when measurement matrix is beyond IID sub-Gaussian. To extend the region of random measurement matrix, an expectation propagation (EP)-related algorithm orthogonal AMP (OAMP) was proposed, which shares the same algorithm with EP, expectation consistent (EC), and vector AMP (VAMP). This paper aims at giving a review for those algorithms. We begin with the worst case, i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) inference problem, and then give the detailed derivation of AMP derived from message passing. Also, in the Bayes-optimal setting, we give the Bayes-optimal AMP which has a slight difference from AMP for LASSO. In addition, we review some AMP-related algorithms: OAMP, VAMP, and Memory AMP (MAMP), which can be applied to more general random matrices.},
