- Configuration
	- A particular position, and oreintation, of the robotic arm is known as configuration.
-  Configuration Space 
	- It is the space where each axis, corresponds to a particular joint angle of the robot. i.e., a N DOF robotic manipulator arm will have N dimensional Configuration Space. A particular configuration, will correspond to a point in C-space. Mostly it will be  topological space.
- DOF
	- "N" Degrees of Freedom means the arm has N independent motions which can execute simultaneously.
- Path
	- A set of way points which on executing will reach the desired configuration.
- Trajectory
	-  A path with timed component such as velocity and accleration.
- Map
	- A data containing the information about the environment and robot. It can be represented by three ways: topological, geometric, and grids.
