## OCT-guided endoscopic laser surgery - A Review
- We confirm that neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration or published in another journal.
-   All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to Diagnostics.

### Why the content of the paper is significant
OCT-guided endoscopic laser surgery has the potential to offer major benefits such as increased awareness of the surgical field and higher accuracy laser ablations, enabling better definition of surgical margins for total tumor eradication with maximum preservation of critical structures, such as nervous tissue, muscles, blood vessels, etc. 

### Why the manuscript fits the scope of the journal.
The review article exhaustively covers using OCT for in-vivo diagnosis in combination with laser surgery.

### Communities for whom our article will appeal
laser surgery, surgical robots, theranostics, endoscopic devices, OCT.

### Justification for our review compared to any other reviews published on a similar topic.

The most recent review paper on endoscopic OCT was published by [Gora et al. in 2017](https://es.sonicurlprotection-fra.com/click?PV=2&MSGID=202210041424060200309&URLID=7&ESV=10.0.16.7295&IV=38698C11D44774FA5C3B143E976D7B42&TT=1664893448910&ESN=bkSOWZUU1h6FcC27q9XE62QqFj9%2FGrcp%2BMlp%2B8ybMQE%3D&KV=1536961729280&B64_ENCODED_URL=aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGcub3B0aWNhLm9yZy9ib2UvZnVsbHRleHQuY2ZtP3VyaT1ib2UtOC01LTI0MDUmYW1wO2lkPTM2Mjg4MA&HK=650AD256F42396E2EAA817990538D5C2C238F09D929632F20559CB0590DAAF6D), and it did not cover OCT-guided laser surgery. In another [review paper](https://es.sonicurlprotection-fra.com/click?PV=2&MSGID=202210041424060200309&URLID=6&ESV=10.0.16.7295&IV=70B6948B32A7313A376EB631636E4402&TT=1664893448910&ESN=Rnl9nvvEnFxlkYC8FW8rrlIlTcQvoBngntQsTA1XmPU%3D&KV=1536961729280&B64_ENCODED_URL=aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGcub3B0aWNhLm9yZy9ib2UvZnVsbHRleHQuY2ZtP3VyaT1ib2UtOC0zLTE2MDcmYW1wO2lkPTM2MDI2Ng&HK=1C86F0F24E6CE83580756063910550BB288EA405E036A19BB8063E68FE57EB8D), OCT-guided laser surgery has been covered only briefly. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature, providing a **comprehensive summary of challenges in combining OCT and high-power laser technologies in an endoscope.**
