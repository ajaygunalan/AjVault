A cyclic executive provides a loop control structure to explicitly interleave execution of more than one periodic process on a single CPU. The cyclic executive is often implemented as a main loop with an invariant loop body known as the cyclic schedule.

A cyclic schedule includes function calls for each periodic service provided within the major period of the overall loop. The loop may include event polling to determine when to dispatch functions, and functions that need to be called at a higher frequency than the main loop will often be called multiple times within the loop. Likewise, functions implementing periodic services that need to be run at much lower frequency than the main loop may be called only on specific loop counts or only when polled events indicate a service request.
