### AMP
Asymmetric Multiprocessing is where each CPU will be used for a specific predetermined function. [RTEmbeddedComponentsSystemsLinuxRTOS]

### SMP
Symmetric Multiprocessing is where each CPU's workload will be assigned dynamically (symmetric).  The OS determines how to assign work to the set of available processors and most often attempts to balance the workload on all processors. An SMP OS is not simple to implement, and overhead for workload balancing can be high, so many embedded multiprocessor systems are asymmetric or distributed.
