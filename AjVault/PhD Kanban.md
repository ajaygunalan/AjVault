## [[Endoscopy Imaging Sensor]]

- [ ] Optics simulation [raytracing](https://pypi.org/project/raytracing/#description)
- [ ] Purchase of [[Scanning Fiber Endoscope]]


## [[Tailored Sensing]]

- [ ] 1.  A quick survey on the biological sample used for compressive sensing in confocal laser microscopy so as to narrow down our sample.
- [ ] 2.  Generate a dataset in CLSM and apply CS/Data-Driven CS to understand the optimal points and image restoration for the given sample.
- [ ] 3.  Depending upon the simulation result, apply CS /Data-Driven CS on CLSM using Galvos or AOD.
- [ ] 4.  When using Galvo, we must ensure that the trajectory covers both optimal points and their smoothness.
- [ ] 5.  All this is done on std. CLSM. Then, We could apply it on the custom hardware using the SPAD array if needed.


## [[Image-Guided Laser Surgery]]]

- [ ] 1.Experimental setup verification of CALM and OCT (manually)
- [ ] 2.Realtime time B-scan Data acquisition
- [ ] 3.Calibration/transform between OCT and CALM system
- [ ] 4.Develop a ROS node to publish to CALM system.
