### Calculation of Hamming Distance

In order to calculate the Hamming distance between two strings, and , we perform their XOR operation, (a⊕ b), and then count the total number of 1s in the resultant string. [ref1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-hamming-distance)

### Example 

Suppose there are two strings 1101 1001 and 1001 1101.

11011001 ⊕ 10011101 = 01000100. Since, this contains two 1s, the Hamming distance, d(11011001, 10011101) = 2. [ref1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-hamming-distance)
