A descriptor is some function that is applied on the patch to describe it in a way that is invariant to all the image changes that are suitable to our application (e.g. rotation, illumination, noise etc.). A descriptor is “built-in” with a distance function to determine the similarity, or distance, of two computed descriptors. So to compare two image patches, we’ll compute their descriptors and measure their similarity by measuring the descriptor similarity, which in turn is done by computing their descriptor distance [ref: 1](https://gilscvblog.com/2013/08/18/a-short-introduction-to-descriptors/).
