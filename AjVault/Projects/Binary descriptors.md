Imagine one can encode most of the information of a patch as a binary string using only comparison of intensity images. This can be done very fast, as only intensity comparisons need to be made. Also, if we use the [[Projects/hamming distance]] as a distance measure between two binary strings, then matching between two patch descriptions can be done using a single instruction, asÂ the hamming distance equals the sum of the XOR operation between the two binary strings. This is exactly the common line and rational behind binary descriptors [ref1](https://gilscvblog.com/2013/08/26/tutorial-on-binary-descriptors-part-1/).
