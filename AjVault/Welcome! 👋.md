### About Me

> *What I cannot create, I do not understand — Richard Feynman.*

I'm a **robotics software engineer** who loves to develop efficient software for robots by leveraging data structures, algorithms, and real-time systems. I find myself happier by supporting others in a diverse team to create impactful technologies.

Right now, I’m a Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Leonardo De Mattos](https://www.iit.it/people/leonardo-demattos) in the [Biomedical Robotics Lab](https://advr.iit.it/index.php/research/biomedical-robotics) at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/). My current research focuses on the development of endoscopic imaging sensor for surgical robots. My previous experiences include developing  [[medical device]], [[humanoid]], [[legged robot]], and [[tele-robotics]].

### Active Projects
- [[Endoscopy Imaging Sensor]]
- [[Tailored Sensing]]
- [[Image-Guided Laser Surgery]]

### Core Expertise
My core expertise is developing production-grade software for robots. I constantly seek to improve my skills in this, and I care a lot about its beauty and optimal. My quest is to find/architect the the Android equivalence OS for robots. 

- [[Data Structures and Algorithms]]
- [[Real-Time Operating System]]
- [[ROS]]
- [[Software Design Patterns]]

### Toolsets
I have a basic understanding of these toolsets. I use these toolsets to deploy robots and will go deep into them based on the requirement. 

- [[Communication-Protocols]]
- [[Signal Processing]]
- [[Controls]]
- [[Motion Planning]]
- [[Optimisation]]

### Hobby Grade Skills
I have done a few tasks using my hobby grade skills, but they may not be optimal solutions. For example, my PCB/circuits may not be optimal in terms of EMI/EMC, cost.

- [[Sensor Conditioning Circuits]]
- [[Motion Control Drivers]]
- [[MEMS]]
- [[Optics]]
