### Upcoming Course

#### Syllabus
   
Level 1: students will learn the internal structure of a Stepper Motor and its physical pros and cons in motion control applications. Then we will focus on drivers and learn how to design a simple circuit making use of dedicated integrated circuits. Students will learn how to program a software to instruct the driver circuit, thus getting on-field experience of a practical application.
  
Level 2: students will exploit the acquired concepts into a more advanced design, where the driver will no longer be a dedicated IC but a programmable microcontroller or IC. They will then realize a real driver where micro stepping will be applied and they will get a fine positioning of the motor. Torque/speed and acceleration issues will be also addressed.
  
Level 3: this module will offer the basic details about Brushless Motors, including their internal structure and function. Students will learn which signals are needed to properly drive such motors and will design a simple real circuit to test in practice, making use of dedicated integrated circuits.
  
Level 4: as for Level 2 above, students will take advantage of the acquired concepts and skills towards a more complex design where they will learn how to implement all the blocks needed in a software for a microcontroller. Among these blocks they will figure out how to deal with Clarke and Park transforms and will finally realize an advanced driver to test in practice
