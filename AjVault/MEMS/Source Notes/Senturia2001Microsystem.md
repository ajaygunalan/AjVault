#### PVD
> "Physical vapor deposition, abbreviated PVD, covers two major methods: evaporation, and sputtering. Evaporation is used primarily for metals" ([Senturia 2001:69](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QAVL3SU?page=69)) ^935ab2

#### Two outcomes of plasma?
> A low-pressure glow-discharge plasma produces ionized species in abundance. When directed to the surface of the wafer, these ions can produce both sputtering effects, *removing material by (1) direct ion-beam bombardment; (2) chemical-reaction effects*, converting surface atoms to volatile species that can be removed by the vacuum pump." ([Senturia 2001:95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QAVL3SU?page=95))

#### What is  [[MEMS/Source Notes/Maluf2002Introduction#Ion Milling|ion milling]] ? & focused ion beam milling?
 > "The least *selective use of ions produced in a plasma* is for the sputtering away of material. This can be done with a blanket exposure to a plasma, for example an argon plasma, removing material from all parts of the wafer. Selectivity is achieved by the relative rate of sputtering of different materials. This process is called **ion milling**. A variant of this process is **focused ion beam milling**" ([Senturia 2001:95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QAVL3SU?page=95))
