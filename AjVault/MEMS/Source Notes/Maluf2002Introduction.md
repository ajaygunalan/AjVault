## Notes

#### Sputter 
^fc4f1a
- [p.56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=56)
- target material to be deposited is bombarded by inert gas ions
- These inert gases can be excited by
	- DC
		- used for conductors
	- RF
		- used for dielectric. 
		- It goes + and  -
	- Ion-beam depsition (Ion Milling)
		- Ions are generated in a plasma
- Is it low or high temperature process?
	- It is low temperature <150 $\deg$ C
- Material that can sputterd?
	- Nearly any inorganic material can sputterd.


#### Evaporation  

^547f9e
- [p.57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=57)
- target material to be deposited is heated to high temperature.
- Done in ______ pressure to avoid  ______ .
	- low
	- contamination
- Rotating the substrate to face source at different angle is done for what? 
	- Evaporation is a directional process thus deposition occurs at a specific angle causing poor step coverage, leaving corners and sidewalls exposed.

#### CVD vs Sputtering
> "In contrast to sputtering, CVD is a hightemperature process, usually performed above 300ÂºC" ([Maluf 2002:286](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=58))


#### Dry etching 
- [p.66](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=66)
> "Dry etching involves the use of reactant gases, usually in a low-pressure plasma, but nonplasma gas-phase etching is also used to a small degree. It can be isotropic or vertical. The equipment for dry etching is specialized and requires the plumbing of ultra-clean pipes to bring highpurity reactant gases into the vacuum chamber."

> "Schematic illustration of cross-sectional trench profiles resulting from four different types of etch methods." ([p.67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=67))

- [[MEMS/Source Notes/Maluf2002Introduction#Dry etching|dry etching]] is also known as ______ etching ^d65c67
	- > "Plasma (or dry) etching" ([p.72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=72))

- What are reactive species?
	- "The reactive species (neutrals and ions) are formed by the collision of molecules in a reactant gas (e.g., SF , CF , Cl , CClF , NF ) with a cloud of energetic electrons excited by an RF electric field." ([Maluf 2002:300](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=72))

##### Difference between [[MEMS/Source Notes/Maluf2002Introduction#^d65c67|plasma etching]]  and RIE?

^64f649

> "When the etch process is purely chemical, powered by the spontaneous reaction of neutrals with silicon, it is colloquially referred to as **plasma etching**. But if ion bombardment of the silicon surface plays a synergistic role in the **chemical etch reaction**, the process is then referred to as **reactive ion etching (RIE)**." ([p.72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=72))

##### Other Stuff

#### ICP-RIE
> "Inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) provides greater excitation to the electron cloud by means of an externally applied RF electromagnetic field. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) increases the density of ions and neutrals resulting in higher etch rates." ([Maluf 2002:301](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=73))

#### Ion Milling
> "purely physical method of etching is ion milling,"
> "Because a chemical reaction is not required, any material can be etched by ion milling. The ion-milling rate is typically much slower than with RIE" ([Maluf 2002:301](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EC8SMNE?page=73))
