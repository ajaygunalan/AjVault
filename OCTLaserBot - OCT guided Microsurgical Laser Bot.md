### Problem Statement

**Computer Assisted Laser Microsurgery** (CALM) [[#^0301ba]], is a custom system previously developed in our lab for laser ablation where the surgeon controls the laser by stylus. In this work, as a step towards autonomous surgery. We will use images as feedback to control the high-power laser.
