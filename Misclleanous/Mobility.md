The exercises you listed target a wide range of muscle groups and joints. Here's a basic breakdown of what muscles are primarily targeted by each stretch:

Mobility A
1. Hang: Shoulders, upper back, and hand grip.
2. Squat: Hip flexors, quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and ankles.
3. Couch Stretch: Hip flexors and quadriceps.
4. Jefferson Curl: Hamstrings and lower back (all the spine when done properly).
5. Crab Stretch: Shoulders, chest, biceps, and hip flexors.
6. Elevated Pigeon: Glutes, hip flexors, and lower back.

Mobility B
1. Hang: Same as above.
2. Straight Leg Hip Hinge: Hamstrings, lower back, and calf muscles.
3. Wall Butterfly: Inner thighs, hips, and lower back.
4. 90/90 Hip IR Isometrics: External and internal hip rotators, glutes.
5. Couch Stretch: Same as above.
6. Butchers Block: Shoulders and triceps, and some upper back.

However, there are a few muscle groups that are less directly targeted by these exercises:

1. Neck: This can be important for overall flexibility and injury prevention. Gentle neck stretches can target these muscles.
2. Wrists: While the hanging exercises might give some mobility work to the wrists, more specific wrist mobility work could be beneficial, especially if you use a computer frequently or are involved in activities like yoga or gymnastics.
3. Feet and ankles: While the squat may provide some ankle mobility, specific exercises for the feet (like toe curls) can be beneficial.
4. Lateral torso (Obliques, QL): Stretches like side bends or rotational movements can target this area.
5. Pectorals: Even though the crab stretch might stretch them, further chest stretches like doorway stretch can be beneficial for those with a sedentary lifestyle or who do lots of pressing movements.

Remember, flexibility training should be balanced and considerate of your personal needs and goals. If you're not sure what areas you should be focusing on, it may be beneficial to consult with a physical therapist or personal trainer.
