## Tolerance
- Is it the deviation from the basic size (nominal size).
- Tolerance can be for size or shape (Geometric Tolerance).

## Limits
- MML is Maximum Metal Limit
- LML is Minimum Metal Limit
- For shaft of 40+/- 0.1 mm; MML = 40.1 mm; LML = 39.9 mm
- For hole  of 40+/- 0.1 mm; MML = 39.9 mm; LML = 40.1 mm

### Allowance
An allowance is an intentional difference between the maximum material limits of mating parts.
It is minimum clearance (positive allowance) in case of clearance fits and maximum interference (negative allowance) in case of interference fit between mating parts
### Hole basis system

In the hole basis system, the different clearances and interferences are obtained by associating various shafts with a single hole, whose lower deviation is zero. The system is shown in the figure below.

hole basis system

In this case, the size of the hole is basic size, and the clearance or interference is applied to the shaft dimension. The system is denoted by the symbol ‘**H**‘.

This system has an advantage over the shaft basis system because holes are drilled by standard drills or reamers having fixed dimensions, while the shafts can be turned or ground to any given dimension. Due to this reason, the hole-basis system is widely used.

### Shaft basis system

In the shaft basis system, the different clearances or interferences are obtained by associating various holes with a single shaft, whose upper deviation is zero. The system is shown in the figure below.

shaft basis system

In this system, the size of the shaft is the basic size, while the clearance or interference is applied to the dimension of the hole. The system is denoted by ‘**_h_**‘.

The shaft basis system is popular in the industries using semi-finished or finished shafting, such as bright bars as raw material.
