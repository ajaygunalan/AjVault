### Notes

Scanning Optics

The _scanning lens_ is fixed and is the final imaging element in the system. Unlike a conventional lens, which has an internal entrance pupil, suitable design places its entrance pupil externally in the plane of a scan element such as a polygon facet. The clear diameter of this facet should exceed entrance pupil diameter. The incident beam diameter (DL) may be that of the aperture of the preceding beam expander lens or the smoothed Gaussian beam diameter (DE) corresponding to the $e^{-2}$ lateral intensity value. If the pupil size is equal to DE then the ratio DE/DL is 1.83. If the lens effective f-number is _N',_ and the focused spot diameter at $e^{-2}$ intensity is $d_E$, then spot size is given by

$$d_E = \frac{D_E \lambda N'}{D_L}$$

For an EFL off, _N' is $f/D_L$.

The emergent beam is deflected through angle $\theta'$ to move the focused spot off-axis by a distance K/2, giving a scanned line length of _K._ It is desirable that K is proportional to incident angle $\theta$, necessitating the relationship

$$K = 2f\theta$$   

If this is so and image position is proportional to the product $f\theta$,_ the lens is said to be f-theta corrected_ or an f-theta lens. Note that this form of projection geometry is also used in fisheye lenses as equidistant projection (Chapter 34).

Also, EFL is important because a low value per­mits a large scan aperture and more compact scanner design.

For a multi-wavelength use, as in colour scanning applications, the normally monochromatically cor­rected lens for a single wavelength must be addition­ally corrected for lateral colour or TCA, to give K identical for different wavelengths, ensuring colour registration.

To provide the necessary BFD to the image plane, a retrofocus configuration is needed which is also beneficial for field flatness.

Where linear scanning is combined with lateral shift of the receiving material, whether film or paper, then an _f-theta rectilinear lens_ can be used using long narrow elements (Figure 60.6(a)). This system is also used in digital photoprinting systems, see Chapter 63.

Where the receptor material is static and the beam must be scanned in two orthogonal directions over the surface, then an _f-theta lens_ with conventional circular elements is needed and a dual deflecting unit directs the laser beam (Figure 60.6(b)).

Another requirement is for an f-theta telecentric lens giving the imaged beam always normal to the focal plane, i.e. $\theta'$ equals zero. This necessitates that the scan facet, entrance pupil and the front focal plane of the lens are coplanar. For non-telecentricity, the image spot is elongated by the factor  $(1- \cos\theta')$  which is only 1.5% for $\theta'$ increased to 10°.

A review of scanning lens design is given by West­cott (1984) and suitable methods of testing the linear­ity of scan lenses at various wavelengths is detailed by Richard (1988). Typical specification of a contempor­ary design is $EFL = 55 mm$, $N' = f/7 .9$, telecentric angular coverage is $\pm14°$, for $A = 632.8 nm$, $d_E$ is $10\mu m$, the pupil distance from facet to lens is 23.5 mm, entrance pupil diameter is 7 mm and scan length is 26.5 mm.
