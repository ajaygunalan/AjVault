Here are some useful links to catch up with the class prerequisites and to integrate the lecture notes.

### Linear Algebra

-   A strong, intuitive understanding of Linear Algebra will very much help you with this class. If off the top of your head you don't remember what the [rank of a matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)) is, or how to do [eigenvalue decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix), we recommend you review your linear algebra. The entire world of robotics is rich in linear algebra -- you will not regret investing time in mastering fundamentals!
-   To brush up on linear algebra, the content and video lectures from Strang's classic course, [MIT 18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm) have helped many students in the past.
-   Another good resource is the textbook _Linear Algebra Done Right_ by Axler.

### Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

-   While a strong understanding of differential equations will only help you, if you have not taken a full ODE course before, you will probably be okay with just understanding the basics.
-   The [Differential Equations content at Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations) should be enough to get you going in the class -- you can learn the rest as you go.

### Coding

-   If you are an absolute beginner with Python, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) provides a friendly introduction.
-   If you are somewhat familiar with Python but would like to brush up on syntax, this [tutorial from Stanford CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) provides a good overview.
-   Although you will not need to know C++ to get an A in the class, the [underlying software](http://drake.mit.edu/) used for some of the assignments is in C++.

### Robotics

-   You will not need any prior robotics exposure to succeed in the class. If however you want to start absorbing fundamentals (frame transformations, manipulator equations, etc.) then [A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/mlswiki/index.php?title=First_edition) by Murray, Li, and Sastry is a great reference.

### Nonlinear Dynamics

-   While not a prerequisite, a fantastic textbook for an introduction to nonlinear dynamics is the textbook [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering) by Strogatz.

### Mathematical Optimization

-   We will teach you all you need to know about optimization, but acquiring a background in the subject will help you deepen understanding. If you know what the following are, you are totally set: LP, QP, SDP, SOS, NLP, MIP.
-   A great textbook on (smooth) optimization is [Numerical Optimization](http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/cnsa/pdf/monograf/Numerical_Optimization2006.pdf) by Nocedal and Wright.
-   Everything you need to know about convex optimization can be found in [Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf) by Boyd and Vandenberghe.
-   For Sums-of-Squares (SOS) programming you can have a look [Parrilo's Thesis](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1647/1/Parrilo-Thesis.pdf) or at [this book](http://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/sdocag/SIAMBookFinalvNov12-2012.pdf).
-   An advanced, but yet very readable, reference for Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) is [Integer Programming](http://solab.kaist.ac.kr/files/IP/IP2017/2014_Integer%20Prog_Conforti-Cornuejols-Zambelli.pdf) by Conforti, Cornuéjols, and Zambelli.

### Machine Learning

-   Basic background in Machine Learning can only help. There are many great introductory classes online, [Ng's](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is one.
-   A couple of lectures will be focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Two great classes on RL are [Silver's](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) and [Levine's](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/). A classical RL textbook is [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf) by Sutton and Barto.

### Optimal Control

-   Optimal control is one of the most powerful tools you'll learn about in this class. If you'd like to dig deeper in this field, the following links might be useful.
-   An extensive reference for Dynamic Programming is [Bertsekas'](http://www.athenasc.com/dpbook.html) book.
-   Two classical references for optimal control are [Applied Optimal Control](https://lib.mit.edu/record/cat00916a/mit.000010902) by Bryson and Ho, and [Optimal Control and Estimation](https://lib.mit.edu/record/cat00916a/mit.002336079) by Stengel.
-   For numerical optimal control (a.k.a. Model Predictive Control) you can have a look at [Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~jbraw/mpc/) by Rawlings, Mayne, and Diehl, and at [Predictive Control for Linear and Hybrid Systems](http://www.mpc.berkeley.edu/mpc-course-material) by Borrelli, Bemporad, and Morari.
