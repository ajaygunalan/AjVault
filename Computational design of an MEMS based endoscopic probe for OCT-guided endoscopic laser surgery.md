To design two probes for forward and circumferential scanning using SMF and Hollow core silica waveguide by fastening them. Scanning is done by a single MEMS mirror, and both are focused. Mirrors provide broadband and high thermal load.

Provide better depth of focus and resolution by spreading PSF and using computational techniques. Capture more information  by Lifght field [[@Liu2017Light]]
