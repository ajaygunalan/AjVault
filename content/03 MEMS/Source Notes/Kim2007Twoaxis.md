## Notes


*What do they mean by actuated statically or at its resonant frequency?

Didn't you read this from a review paper? (A canadian univ and indian girl) ([note on p.18133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E44YKFW6?page=4))*

> "imaging non-tubular organs, conventional catheters scanning linearly are limited in scanning speed to a few frames/s due to various factors including large inertia, friction, and compliance related to proximal actuation. Furthermore, these translational catheters can only generate 2D images by scanning along a single axis. Therefore, the conventional OCT catheters are the limiting factor for high-speed 3D imaging of non-tubular organs." ([Kim 2007:18133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E44YKFW6?page=4))

#### This MEMS scanner can be actuated either statically or at its resonant frequency (>= 350Hz).

*Why distal scanning instead of proximal scanning? ([note on p.18133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E44YKFW6?page=4))*
