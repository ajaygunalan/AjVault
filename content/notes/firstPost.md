## Making your own Quartz
Setting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!

### Forking
> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:

üìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)

Then, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free.
