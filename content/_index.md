I'm a robotics software engineer with three years of experience. I love to develop efficient software for robots leveraging data structures, algorithms, and real-time systems and support others in a diverse team to create impactful technologies. 

Right now, I’m a Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Leonardo De Mattos](https://www.iit.it/people/leonardo-demattos) in the [Biomedical Robotics Lab](https://advr.iit.it/index.php/research/biomedical-robotics) at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/). My current research focuses on the development of endoscopic imaging sensor for surgical robots. My previous experiences include developing [[medical device]], [[humanoid]], [[legged robot]], and [[tele-robotics]].

##### About This Site
This site is work in progress, and slowly transferring from [ajaygunalan.com](https://ajaygunalan.com/) to here. This is my obsidian-based digital garden a.k.a. personal knowledge management system.  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note making app comparable to Evernote and Notion. However, in my opinion, better  😉 😀😎. I use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which is free, to host my notes rather than [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). Quartz is not an exact replica of the local obsidian since it is in development. However, it is sufficient enough to host your notes online.
