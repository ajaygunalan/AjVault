## Hi, I'm Ajay Gunalan

A robotics software engineer with 3+ years of experience in sensors and actuators with a strong engineering background. I love to develop efficient solutions and support others in a diverse team to develop impactful technologies. 

Right now, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student advised byÂ [Dr. Leonardo De Mattos](https://www.iit.it/people/leonardo-demattos)Â in theÂ [Biomedical Robotics Lab](https://advr.iit.it/index.php/research/biomedical-robotics)Â at theÂ [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/). My current research focuses on the development of endoscopic imaging sensor for surgical robots. My previous experiences include developingÂ [[medical devices]],Â [humanoid](https://ajaygunalan.github.io/projects/past/asimov.html),Â [legged robot](https://ajaygunalan.github.io/projects/past/stoch.html), and real-time streaming of audio, video, and PCL forÂ [telerobot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl5wQ8cF8U4).

##### About This Site
This is my obsidian-based digital garden a.k.a. personal knowledge management system.  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note making app comparable to Evernote and Notion. However, in my opinion, better  ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Ž. I use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which is free, to host my notes rather than [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). Quartz is not an exact replica of the local obsidian since it is in development. However, it is sufficient enough to host your notes online.
