## Hi, I'm Ajay Gunalan
This is my obsidian-based digital garden a.k.a. personal knowledge management system.  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note making app comparable to Evernote and Notion. However, in my opinion, better.  ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Ž

##### Disclaimer
I use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which is free, to host my notes rather than [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). Quartz is not an exact replica of the local obsidian since it is in development. However, it is sufficient enough to host your notes online.
