## Hi, I'm Ajay Gunalan
This is my obsidian-based digital garden and personal knowledge management system.  [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is comparable to Evernote and Notion. However, in my opinion, better.  ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Ž

## Map of Content
- [[Data Structures and Algorithm]]
- [[Real-Time Systems]]

##### Miscellaneous Notes
[[Surgical-Robots]], [[Surgical-Topics]], [[Food]], [[Gym]], [[Jobs]], 

##### Disclaimer
I use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which is free, to host my notes rather than [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). Although Quartz is still under development, there are some problems. As a result, it is not an exact replica of the local obsidian. However, it is sufficient to begin hosting your notes online.
