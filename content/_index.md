I'm a robotics software engineer who loves to develop efficient software for robots by leveraging data structures, algorithms, and real-time systems. I find it satisfactory and happy to support others in a diverse team to create impactful technologies.

Right now, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student advised byÂ [Dr. Leonardo De Mattos](https://www.iit.it/people/leonardo-demattos)Â in theÂ [Biomedical Robotics Lab](https://advr.iit.it/index.php/research/biomedical-robotics)Â at theÂ [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/). My current research focuses on the development of endoscopic imaging sensor for surgical robots. My previous experiences include developingÂ [[medical device]],Â [[humanoid]],Â [[legged robot]], and [[tele-robotics]].


### Active Projects
- [[Endoscopy Imaging Sensor]]
- [[Tailored Sensing]]
- [[Image-Guided Laser Surgery]]

### Core Expertise
As I said, my core expertise is developing production-grade software for robots. I constantly seek to improve my skills in this, and I care a lot about its beauty and optimal. My quest is to find/architect the the Android equivalence OS for robots. 

- [[Data Structures and Algorithm]]
- [[Real-Time Operating System]]
- [[ROS]]

### Hobby Grade Skills
I have done a few tasks using my hobby grade skills, but these are hobby grade levels. For example, my PCB/circuits may not be optimal in terms of EMI/EMC, cost. My website maybe not be secure, My controls might be hand-tuned, etc. 

- [[Communication-Protocols]]
- [[Signal Processing]]
- [[Controls]]
- [[Motion Planning]]
- [[Optimisation]]
- [[Sensor Conditioning Circuits]]
- [[Motion Control Drivers]]
- [[MEMS]]
- [[Optics]]

##### About This Site
This site is work in progress, and slowly transferring from [ajaygunalan.com](https://ajaygunalan.com/) to here. This is my obsidian-based digital garden a.k.a. personal knowledge management system.  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note making app comparable to Evernote and Notion. However, in my opinion, better  ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Ž. I use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which is free, to host my notes rather than [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). Quartz is not an exact replica of the local obsidian since it is in development. However, it is sufficient enough to host your notes online.
