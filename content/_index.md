## Hi, I'm Ajay Gunalan
This is my Digital Garden/Personal Knowledge Management/Zettelkasten based on [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian is similar to Notion & Evernote. But, better in my opinion ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Ž.

##### Disclaimer
Instead of using [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) to host my notes,  I use [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which is free. Quartz is still in development, and there are a few issues. Thus, it is not a 100%  replica of local [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). But, It is good enough to start hosting your notes online.
