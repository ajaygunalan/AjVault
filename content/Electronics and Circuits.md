**Learning Outcomes (short)**

Level 1: analog and digital electronics

Level 2: mixed signals and data conversion

Level 3: design of electronic modules

Level 4: more advanced design techniques

**Learning Outcomes (further info)**

Level 1: learning basic Operational Amplifier circuit design and practices; learning digital electronics basics.

Level 2: understanding Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog conversion and being able to write the specifications of an analog system for signal conditioning and of a mixed-signal system (signal conditioning, data acquisition, filtering) to provide to a thirdy-part designer or to select an off-the-shelf solution available on the market

Level 3: more electronic components; schematic circuit design of “standard modules” to be used as building-blocks in more complex or custom systems

Level 4: more advanced technical issues (e.g. circuit layout dos and don’ts), circuit design best practices, CAD tools.

**Syllabus/Content**

Level 1: students will learn the Operational Amplifier and will be able to go through a typical Datasheet, understanding the various features and characteristic curves. In this module they will practice with basic circuits while learning how to optimize the design in terms of requested features (e.g. noise, stability, etc.).

In the second part students will go through the basics of digital design, confining the activities on typical digital building blocks useful for the following Level 1 module.

Level 2: students will mix the acquired concepts into the A/D and D/A technologies, learning how to select the appropriate converter for a given application especially in terms of  resolution and speed. They will afford a real-case situation where an input analog signal must be pre-processed and filtered before the converter stage.

Level 3: this module will offer some details about other components useful to afford the design of more complex systems. Based on the knowledge of the two preceding modules, students will be ready to design circuits intended as more or less standard building blocks for complex applications, determining the design parameters and selecting the best options vs. the case study. Examples of real-life schematics will offer a good dictionary of solutions.

Level 4: with the background of the preceding modules, it is time to go the insights of the electronic design with a series of good and bad circuits to analyze and discuss, exploiting what learned till now and being ready to understand what are the best practices of “the art of electronics”. Students will also approach a CAD program to design circuits and the corresponding Printed Circuit Boards.
