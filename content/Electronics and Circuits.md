This is an excellent course from Univeristy of Genova by [Marco Sartore](https://www.elbatech.com/aboutus.html) of Elba Tech. I will finish these notes when I need to build a custom sensor.  Basically it is about senor signal conditioning circuit.

Due to copyright, I cannot make the videos public. But, I can make my notes public.
