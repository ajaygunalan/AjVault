### thread
When you run two simple executables, you create two processes that the OS independently schedules. Processes are also independently scheduled by OS. But,  they exist within a process by duplicating only the bare essential resources that enable them to exist as executable code [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/what_is_a_thread/).

### pthread
POSIX threads, or Pthreads are std. UNIX threads. They are defined as a set of C language programming types and procedure calls, implemented with aÂ `pthread.h`Â header/include file and a thread library - though this library may be part of another library, such asÂ `libc`, in some implementations [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/what_are_pthreads/). They use less resource than process and  are efficient in data exchange [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/why_pthreads/).


### when pthreads?
-   Work that can be executed, or data that can be operated on, by multiple tasks simultaneously:
-   Block for potentially long I/O waits
-   Use many CPU cycles in some places but not others
-   Must respond to asynchronous events
-   Some work is more important than other work (priority interrupts)

Several common models for threaded programs exist:, Manager/worker, Pipeline, Peer. Threads have common shared memory and private memory. When accessing common memory, they have to synchronize. Be careful if your application uses libraries or other objects that donâ€™t explicitly guarantee thread-safeness. When in doubt, assume that they are not **thread-safe** until proven otherwise. For example, `OpenCV::imshow()` is not thread-safe. I suffered a lot to learn this, Lolz!! ðŸ˜… [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/designing_threaded_programs/).


The Pthreads API subroutines can be informally grouped into:Thread management, Mutexes, Condition variables, Synchronization [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/pthreads_api/).


### Thread Creation &Termination
##### Thread creation

`pthread_create(&threadId[t], NULL, PrintHello, (void *)t);`

1. Thread ID is of type `pthread_t` (`unsigned long`) 
2. Thread attributes
3. Subroutine to be called
4. Argument for subroutine

##### Thread Termination

There are several ways in which a thread may be terminated:

-   The thread returns normally from its starting routine. Its work is done.
-   The thread makes a call to theÂ `pthread_exit`Â subroutine - whether its work is done or not.
-   The thread is canceled by another thread via theÂ `pthread_cancel`Â routine.
-   The entire process is terminated due to making a call to either theÂ `exec()`Â orÂ `exit()`
-   IfÂ `main()`Â finishes first, without callingÂ `pthread_exit`Â explicitly itself

###### Code
```C++ HL:"10,20,28"
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define NUM_THREADS 5

 void *PrintHello(void *threadid)
 {
    long tid;
    tid = (long)threadid;
    printf("Hello World! It's me, thread #%ld!\n", tid);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
 }

 int main (int argc, char *argv[])
 {
    pthread_t threadId[NUM_THREADS];
    int rc;
    long t;
    for(t=0; t<NUM_THREADS; t++){
       printf("In main: creating thread %ld\n", t);
       rc = pthread_create(&threadId[t], NULL, PrintHello, (void *)t);
       if (rc){
          printf("ERROR; return code from pthread_create() is %d\n", rc);
          exit(-1);
       }
    }

    /* Last thing that main() should do */
    pthread_exit(NULL);
 }
```

### Thread Join

Thread Join is one way to accomplish synchronization between threads. Two other methods are  [[mutexes]] and [[condition variables]]. TheÂ `pthread_join()`Â subroutine blocks the calling thread until the specified thread terminates. When a thread is created, one of its attributes defines whether it is joinable or detached. Only threads that are created as joinable can be joined. If a thread is created as detached, it can never be joined [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/joining_and_detaching/).

`pthread_join(threads[i], &status);` 
1. `threads[i]` is the unqiue id.
2. `status` is the return status

###### Code
```C++, HL:"45"
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sched.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 64

typedef struct
{
    int threadIdx;
} threadParams_t;


// POSIX thread declarations and scheduling attributes
pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
threadParams_t threadParams[NUM_THREADS];


void *counterThread(void *threadp)
{
    int sum=0, i;
    threadParams_t *threadParams = (threadParams_t *)threadp;

    for(i=1; i < (threadParams->threadIdx)+1; i++)
        sum=sum+i;
 
    printf("Thread idx=%d, sum[1...%d]=%d\n", 
           threadParams->threadIdx,
           threadParams->threadIdx, sum);
}


int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int rc, i;
   void *status;

   for(i=1; i <= NUM_THREADS; i++)
   {
       threadParams[i].threadIdx=i;
       pthread_create(&threads[i], (void *)0, counterThread, (void *)&(threadParams[i]));
   }

   for(i=0;i<NUM_THREADS;i++) {
      pthread_join(threads[i], &status);
      printf("Main: completed join with thread %ld having a status of %ld\n",i,(long)status);  
   }


   printf("TEST COMPLETE\n");
}
}
```
