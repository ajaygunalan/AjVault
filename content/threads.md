### thread
When you run two simple executables, you create two processes that the OS independently schedules. Processes are also independently scheduled by OS. But,  they exist within a process by duplicating only the bare essential resources that enable them to exist as executable code [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/what_is_a_thread/).

### pthread
POSIX threads, or Pthreads are std. UNIX threads. They are defined as a set of C language programming types and procedure calls, implemented with aÂ `pthread.h`Â header/include file and a thread library - though this library may be part of another library, such asÂ `libc`, in some implementations [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/what_are_pthreads/). They use less resource than process and  are efficient in data exchange [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/why_pthreads/).


### when pthreads?
-   Work that can be executed, or data that can be operated on, by multiple tasks simultaneously:
-   Block for potentially long I/O waits
-   Use many CPU cycles in some places but not others
-   Must respond to asynchronous events
-   Some work is more important than other work (priority interrupts)

Several common models for threaded programs exist:, Manager/worker, Pipeline, Peer. Threads have common shared memory and private memory. When accessing common memory, they have to synchronize. Be careful if your application uses libraries or other objects that donâ€™t explicitly guarantee thread-safeness. When in doubt, assume that they are not **thread-safe** until proven otherwise. For example, `OpenCV::imshow()` is not thread-safe. I suffered a lot to learn this, Lolz!! ðŸ˜… [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/designing_threaded_programs/).


The Pthreads API subroutines can be informally grouped into:Thread management, Mutexes, Condition variables, Synchronization [ref](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/pthreads_api/).


### Pthread Creation and Termination

GitHub Link: [threadCreateTerminate.c](threadCreateTerminate)

##### Thread creation

`pthread_create(&threadId[t], NULL, PrintHello, (void *)t);`

1. Thread ID is of type `pthread_t` (`unsigned long`) 
2. Thread attributes
3. Subroutine to be called
4. Argument for subroutine

##### Thread Termination

There are several ways in which a thread may be terminated:

-   The thread returns normally from its starting routine. Its work is done.
-   The thread makes a call to theÂ `pthread_exit`Â subroutine - whether its work is done or not.
-   The thread is canceled by another thread via theÂ `pthread_cancel`Â routine.
-   The entire process is terminated due to making a call to either theÂ `exec()`Â orÂ `exit()`
-   IfÂ `main()`Â finishes first, without callingÂ `pthread_exit`Â explicitly itself
