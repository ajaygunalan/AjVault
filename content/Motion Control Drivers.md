### AIMS AND CONTENT 
**Learning Outcomes (short)**

Level 1: Stepper Motors and their drivers - basics Level 2: Stepper Motors advanced topics
   
Level 3: Brushless Motors and their drivers - basics Level 4: Brushless Motors advanced topics
   
**Learning Outcomes (further info)**
   
Level 1: learning how a Stepper Motor is composed and how it must be correctly driven, combining its mechanical features with driver’s requirements, up to the realization of a simple electronic circuit to interface a Stepper Motor.
   
Level 2: understanding the insights of fine drivers for Stepper Motors, learning microstepping techniques and their practical application in the physical realization of an advanced driver.
   
Level 3: understanding the structure of Brushless Motors as compared with the brushed ones, their driving needs and how to fulfill their requirements, with the practical realization of a simple driver using dedicated integrated circuits.
   
Level 4: learning the details of Brushless Motors drivers up to programming a microcontroller as the smart portion of an advanced driver.
   
**Syllabus/Content**
   
Level 1: students will learn the internal structure of a Stepper Motor and its physical pros and cons in motion control applications. Then we will focus on drivers and learn how to design a simple circuit making use of dedicated integrated circuits. Students will learn how to program a software to instruct the driver circuit, thus getting on-field experience of a practical application.
  
Level 2: students will exploit the acquired concepts into a more advanced design, where the driver will no longer be a dedicated IC but a programmable microcontroller or IC. They will then realize a real driver where micro stepping will be applied and they will get a fine positioning of the motor. Torque/speed and acceleration issues will be also addressed.
  
Level 3: this module will offer the basic details about Brushless Motors, including their internal structure and function. Students will learn which signals are needed to properly drive such motors and will design a simple real circuit to test in practice, making use of dedicated integrated circuits.
  
Level 4: as for Level 2 above, students will take advantage of the acquired concepts and skills towards a more complex design where they will learn how to implement all the blocks needed in a software for a microcontroller. Among these blocks they will figure out how to deal with Clarke and Park transforms and will finally realize an advanced driver to test in practice
  
**Teaching Methods**
Classes will be held in a Laboratory and formed by two intersected types:

taught-lessons to offer a clear explanation of the theoretical foundations and methods of circuit design (at the various Levels enumerated above)
   
practical-lessons where students will be guided to physically realize the explained circuits using a set of provided components, performing all the measurements to test and verify them by means of provided instruments.
   
**Exam Description**
The students will be asked to realize the described drivers in the Labs and to demonstrate their functioning when connected to a test motor, performing the necessary measurements. They will write a report describing the driver(s) and the related results.
   
**Assessment Methods**
Continuous assessment throughout the course with verification of students’ interest and care, plus a final evaluation of the exam result and report.
