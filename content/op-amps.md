### Why Op-amp?
You must be aware that transistors can function as amplifiers. However, an amplifier made from a single transistor has some drawbacks. By combining several transistors and other components in an integrated circuit known as an op-amp, we can get around these restrictions.

### What it  does?
If the voltage applied to the non-inverting terminal ($V_+$) > the voltage applied to the inverting terminal ($V_-$) , the output saturates toward the positive supply voltage $+V_s$. Conversely,  If the voltage applied to the inverting terminal ($V_-$) > the voltage applied to the non-inverting terminal ($V_+$) , the output saturates toward the negative supply voltage ($-V_S$). This "maxing out" effect occurs with the slightest difference in voltage between the input terminals. [Pg635PracticalElectronicsForInventors](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WMPQQ98V?page=664)
