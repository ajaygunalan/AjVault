**Problem**

In laser surgery, a poorly focused laser results in inferior cutting quality. Given the sensitivity of optical elements, the laser may easily lose focus and misalign. To address this, we use the sound produced by laser ablation on tissue as an indicator for the surgeon to properly focus the laser.

**Steps**
1. Use standard music for recognition.
2. Record a conversation and recognize it.
3. Recognize the laser sound.
