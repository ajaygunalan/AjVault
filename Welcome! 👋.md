### About Me

> *What I cannot create, I do not understand — Richard Feynman.*


I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/). My current research focuses on the development of novel laser technologies for micro-surgical robots. My previous experiences include developing  [[Medical Device]], [[Humanoid]], [[Legged Robot]], and [[Tele-Robotics]].

My vision is to make healthcare affordable by merging medicine and engineering. In this process, I love working with a diverse team to develop transformative tech and solve new challenges each day.
