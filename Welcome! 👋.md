This is my **digital garden**, a.k.a personal knowledge management system.

### About Me

> *What I cannot create, I do not understand — Richard Feynman.*

I'm a **robotics software engineer** who loves developing algorithms for robots by clearly understanding the state of algorithms in **perception, planning and controls**. I find myself happier by supporting others in a diverse team to create impactful technologies.

Right now, I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/). My current research focuses on the development of novel laser technologies for surgical robots. My previous experiences include developing  [[Medical Device]], [[Humanoid]], [[Legged Robot]], and [[Tele-Robotics]].
